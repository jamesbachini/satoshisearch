The PRNG test which requires DT to be run as a monotonic counter is, in
fact, a known-answer test.  To run that test at all, if one's PRNG is
implemented (as was permitted prior to the introduction of that test)
with DT as an actual clock, one has to alter the mode of operation of
the PRNG in a rather fundamental way.

I'm not sure what you're suggesting, but I think you misunderstand the
difference between the validation tests for AES and those for the PRNG.
The validation tests for AES do not dictate internal implementation details
of the DUT beyond the extent specified in the controlling standards, and
thus a conformant AES implementation cannot need to have its internals
rearranged in order to be attached to the test fixture.

That is *not* the case for the X9.17 PRNG and the test now specified for
it, which means that the test, itself, creates new opportunities for very
nasty bugs, or requires those who implemented the PRNG using a clock or
free-running counter to reimplement using a simple counter.  I tend to
think that this is a regrettable decrease in the strength of the RNG
but that, regardless, implementations of an algorithm should be required
to actually run the validated algorithm, not some other one that is close,
except that part of the algorithm's guts were swapped out for testing.
