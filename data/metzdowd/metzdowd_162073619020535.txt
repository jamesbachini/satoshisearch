We had here in Germany this problem with many banks. Describing the
problem to them did not help. Writing an article for a large German
computer magazine about this problem did help.

E.g. Commerzbank and ING-DiBa now uses https for all web services.
Others like Sparkasses have a login button which leads to the SSL
protected login fields. (These are samples for the current good state.
Don't remember if all these banks had the problem before my article.)
