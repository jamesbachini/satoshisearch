Perry,

I have copied the IEEE 1619.3 Working Group where disk-drive
manufacturers are working on some of these KM issues.

There is a debate going on on that list about the value of
encrypting data at the disk-drive layer vs. encrypting at the
application layer - I believe the latter is a more strategic
solution - and the voices from the Crypto forum would be
welcome on these issues.

I will let the FDE vendors respond to you so you can forward
as appropriate.  Thanks.
