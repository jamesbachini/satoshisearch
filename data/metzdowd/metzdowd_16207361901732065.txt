Not USB, but ...

There is an excellent Open Source design for a true random number
generator using a sound card at: <A HREF="http://www.av8n.com/turbid/">http://www.av8n.com/turbid/</A>

Since many servers will have an unused sound card equivalent on
the motherboard, and a cheapo sound card is an easy addition to
others, this strikes me as a good solution.
