There is a mechanism whereby US donors can send tax deductible donations 
to the trust. Go to <A HREF="http://www.cafamerica.org">http://www.cafamerica.org</A> and search for the Codes 
and Ciphers Heritage Trust. I helped them rebuild Colossus a couple of 
years ago, and have just donated some more (thanks, Perry). Note, 
though, minimum donation is $500.
