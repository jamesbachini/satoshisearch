  Hear hear!  This maxim should be burned into the frontal lobes of every
single member of Microsoft's engineering (and marketing) teams with a red-hot
poker[*].

[  Over-engineered solutions to non-problems and gratuitous marketing-driven
featuritis have been the root cause of almost every windows security disaster
ever - e.g., email featuring 'rich content' such as scripts; web browsers that
download and locally run active-x from random websites; lots of vulnerable RPC
services installed and enabled by default on home user PCs; ... etc etc.;
certainly they have far outnumbered the occasional flaws in core kernel
services.  But - economics again!, and a tip'o the hat to Schneier and his
externalities argument - as long as the extra sales go to Microsoft's coffers,
and the extra costs are all imposed on their victims^Wusers, there's no
incentive for them to do otherwise.  Hence my suggestion that they need a
red-hot one (incentive, that is).  ]

    cheers,
