Another back-of-the-envelope estimate would be to look at the EFF
machine that could brute force s 56-bit DES key in a few days and
cost $200-odd thousand. That was 10 years ago and Moore's Law
applies, so it should be about 100 times faster or cheaper now.

Round numbers are nice. Overestimating the attacker a bit is
better than underestimating. So assume an attacker can brute
force a a 64-bit key (256 times harder than DES) in a second
(a few 100 thousand times faster).

Brute force against a 96-bit key should take 2^32 times as long.
Since pi seconds is a nano-century, that's somewhat over a
century. For a 128-bit key, over 2^32 centuries. If brute force
is the best attack, this is obviously secure.
