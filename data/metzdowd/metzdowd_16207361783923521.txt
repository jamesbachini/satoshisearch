For the linux kernel, there is a paper:

<A HREF="http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/086">http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/086</A>

Another important aspect is the semantics of the devices: None of the
/dev/*random devices are standardized anywhere (as far as I know).
There semantics can and do differ.  This is a larger practical problem.

For example, reading a lot of data from linux's /dev/urandom will
deplete the entropy pool in the kernel, which effectively makes reads
from /dev/random stall.  The two devices uses the same entropy pool.

I believe a much better approach would be if /dev/urandom was a fast and
secure PRNG, with perfect-forward-secrecy properties, and /dev/random
was a slow device with &quot;real&quot; entropy (whatever that means..) gathered
from the hardware.  The two devices would share little or no code.  The
/dev/urandom PRNG seed could be fed data from /dev/random from time to
time, or from other sources (like kernel task switching timings).  I
believe designs like this have been proposed from time to time, but
there hasn't been any uptake.
