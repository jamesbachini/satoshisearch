Of course, this problem isn't limited to Wells Fargo:  I think pretty
much all banks do it.

I've given this some thought, and am writing a program called &quot;maiden&quot;
(short for &quot;mother's maiden name&quot;) for cryptographically answering
these questions.

The basic idea is that you take either a pass phrase or strong secret,
combine it with the question, compute the SHA hash, and use this to
create a word that looks semi-pronounceable as the answer to the
question.

Right now, I don't answer any of these questions with any guessable
information -- it's all the result of a cryptographic operation on the
question and a hidden secret.

Cheers,
-Matt
