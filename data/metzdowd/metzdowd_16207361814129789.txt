Certainly, it is not mutual exclusive. However factor an RSA key
hardly can help with that.

A) All the authorities ever need is always *a* person, and then they can do
the rest. In this particular case the *real* solution of the problem would be
trace the money dropper and bust the chain. The only required cryptanalysis
here is a thermo-rectal one.

B) It not about legal or illegal code, it is not about a code at all.
Blackmailing
for ransom is a crime and demanding a ransom for digital assets does not
make this any different. A crime must be addressed as a crime in a first place.
