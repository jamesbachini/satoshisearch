It depends on how we think change can be achieved. Until now, people 
designing pages using bad security practices balanced their laziness 
with the fact that their content would be displayed anyway so 
whatever. You are proposing moving to the other extreme. Given how 
easy your solution would be for browser vendors to implement, we have 
to assume that they have considered it and rejected it.

A less extreme solution would be to make the warning the user sees on 
a mixed-content page more insulting to the bank. &quot;This page contains 
both encrypted and non-encrypted content and is inherently insecure. 
The owner of this web site has clearly made a very poor security 
decision in showing this page to you. It is likely that other pages 
on this site also have similarly poor security. Knowing this, do you 
wish to continue anyway?&quot;
