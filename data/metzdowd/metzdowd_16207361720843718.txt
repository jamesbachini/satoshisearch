<PRE>Various browsers (e.g. Firefox and IE) recently implemented the latest fashion
in &quot;security&quot;, EV certs (already discussed on this list in the past) and
blacklists, neither of which have much effect on phishing but both of which
make great security fashion statements.

Unfortunately, it looks like Safari, which doesn't follow the trend, has
fallen victim to the fashionistas:

   PayPal warns: Steer clear of Apple's Safari browser

   If you're using Apple's Safari browser, PayPal has some advice for you:
   Drop it, at least if you want to avoid online fraud.

   [...]

   Unlike its competitors, Safari has no built-in phishing filter to warn
   users when they are visiting suspicious Web sites, Barrett said. Another
   problem is Safari's lack of support for another anti-phishing technology,
   called Extended Validation (EV) certificates. This is a secure Web browsing
   technology that turns the address bar green when the browser is visiting a
   legitimate Web site.

Looks like Safari just isn't the look to be sporting this year... maybe Apple
could invent their own security fashion and then criticise Paypal for being so
five minutes ago in its look.
