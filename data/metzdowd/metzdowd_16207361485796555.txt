as i've mentioned before ... we looked at somewhat similar hardware solution
(but much simpler) for the original acorn (ibm/pc code name), primarily as software piracy 
countermeasure  ... but the tamper resistant technology state of the art at the time was 
way too expensive ... and investigation was dropped. what was seen during
the 80s were things like those specially encoded floppy disks ... that had 
to be inserted when you started the application ... a couple past posts/references:

in the late 90s i would periodically chide the TPM folks about what
they were doing ... and at an assurance talk i gave in the trusted computing
track at intel developers forum (spring 2001), i chided the guy running
the effort (was sitting in the front row) that it was nice to see that 
over the previous couple yrs that TPM had started to look more &amp; more
like the AADS chip strawman. his retort was something about it being
because I didn't have a committee of couple hundred people helping
me with (my) chip design.
