<PRE>archeological email about proposal for doing pgp-like public key
(from 1981):

the internal network was larger than the arpanet/internet from
just about the beginning until sometime summer of '85. corporate
guidelines had become that all links/transmission leaving corporate
facilities were required to be encrypted. in the '80s this met
lots of link encryptors (in the mid-80s, there was claim that
internal network had over half of all the link encryptors in the world).

a major crypto problem was with just about every link that crossed any
national boundary created problems with both national gov. links
within national boundaries would usually get away with argument
that it was purely internal communication within the same
corporate entity. then there was all sorts of resistance encountered
attempting to apply that argument to links that cross national
boundary (from just about every national entity).

For other archeological lore ... old posting with new networking
activity from 1983
<A HREF="http://www.garlic.com/2006k.html#8">http://www.garlic.com/2006k.html#8</A>

above posting includes listing of locations (around the world)
that had one or more new network links (on the internal
network) added sometime during 1983 (large precentage
involved connections requiring link encryptors).

mentioning coming to the realization (in the 80s) that there
were three kinds of crypto.
