I totally disagree that this is a material problem that is in any meaningful
way impeding the use of SSL client certificates (there are totally different
reasons that client certs aren't being widely adopted, but that's beside the
point).

However, TLS supports what you want right now: just do the initial handshake
without client auth, then renegotiate after the session encryption starts.
The renegotiation will happen under the encrypted, identity-protected and
server-authenticated session, and client authentication can be requested in
the renegotiation; the client cert will then be confidential.

The reason nobody actually bothers to do this is because there's no customer
demand (see paragraph 1).
