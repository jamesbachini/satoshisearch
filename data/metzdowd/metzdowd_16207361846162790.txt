Indeed.  But it's as quiet as the old list :/

Seriously, the work of the BTNS WG is, IMO, crucial to the use of IPsec
as an end-to-end solution (as opposed to as a VPN solution, for which
IPsec is already pretty darned good).  If you care, then please
participate, or even better, implement.

That anyone is working on IPETEE indicates that end-to-end IPsec
solutions are desired.  The in-band nature of the IPETEE key exchange
indicates, to me, a dislike of IKE, or perhaps unawareness of BTNS WG
(man, the WG's name doesn't reflect very well what it does), or perhaps
a misunderstanding of IPsec.
