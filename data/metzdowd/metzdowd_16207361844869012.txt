This is a paper published on arXiv in March that does not contain the  
type of information NXP is suing over, which is why it was removed  
from Wikileaks.

The law suit is about a full disclosure of the Crypto1 security system  
that would allow anybody to build attack tools. However, as we all  
know, It would also convince more users of Mifare to consider  
upgrading to more secure technologies and potentially enable  
researchers to find countermeasures. The benefits clearly outweigh the  
risks since half a year after announcing the vulnerabilities, Mifare  
Classic is hopefully not used in any high security application anymore.
