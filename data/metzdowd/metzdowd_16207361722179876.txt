You can get a fairly high-bandwidth channel with 2D barcodes. It's
uni-directional, but that's enough for many useful scenarios. The data
gets shown on the PC monitor and is captured by a ubiquitous
camera-phone or a dedicated locked-down device. This approach avoids
the problems you mentioned about USB/Firewire/Ethernet lockdown.
