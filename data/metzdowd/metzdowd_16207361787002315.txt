&gt;<i> Debian seem to be particularly bad for not reporting changes to
</I>&gt;<i> maintainers,

This shouldn't be the case.  There's a clear policy that non-packaging
changes (basically, anything beyond trivial build fixes and pathname
changes for FHS compliance) should be submitted upstream.

&gt;<i> I've got a few packages that are contained in a number of distros and
</I>&gt;<i> I notice via occasional Google searches for semi-related items that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm getting hits to CVS change logs for my code where someone is
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly re-applying some patch to every new version I release.
</I>
If you name names, we can certainly fix that.  I couldn't figure out
what packages are affected on Debian's side.
