Perhaps this section wasn't updated?  A password-based lock method is
present in most laptop drives today.

But this exhibits an issue with disk-based encryption: you can't
really know what they are doing, and if they are doing it right.
(Given countless examples of badly-deployed cryptography, this isn't
just paranoia, but a real concern.)
