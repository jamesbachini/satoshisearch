You may be confusing the requirements for a KAT which is a power-up health
check on all of the deterministic components of the PRNG (which is run on
power-up and requires that you fix all the inputs to some specific known
value and verify that a known result is produced) and the requirements
for algorithm testing of your PRNG (which for X9.17/X9.31, does require
treating DT as a monotonic counter for one portion of the test).

That's your choice, of course.

So, did they require that you use your AES implementation using the test
fixture as well?
