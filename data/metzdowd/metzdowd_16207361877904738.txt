Quoting:

    New microchipped passports designed to be foolproof against
    identity theft can be cloned and manipulated in minutes and
    accepted as genuine by the computer software recommended for use
    at international airports.

    Tests for The Times exposed security flaws in the microchips
    introduced to protect against terrorism and organised crime. The
    flaws also undermine claims that 3,000 blank passports stolen last
    week were worthless because they could not be forged.
