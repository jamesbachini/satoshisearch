That's an IV.  I strongly suggest your read the Ritchie and Thompson
paper on the reasons for the salt.  While making sure that two
identical passwords rarely hashed to the same value, it had another
purpose: protecting against hardware attacks.  Ritchie and Thompson
assumed that there would be generic DES chips; they didn't want those
to be used in a password-cracking machine.  Accordingly, the salt was
used to permute the E-box -- not the S-boxes -- to prevent that.
