<PRE>GOST resists the attacks that have recently been
discovered against commonly used hashes because it has
512 bits of internal state.  It combines a simple 256
bit checksum with a simple 256 bit digest.

I cannot see any use for the checksum other than to
resist this type of attack against the digest, which
suggests that the Russians may have been aware of this
kind of attack in 1990.
