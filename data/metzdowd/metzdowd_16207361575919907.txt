<PRE>For people who don't read LKML (or get interesting bits forwarded to them),
there's a wonderful quote by Linus Torvalds about the difference between OS
scheduler design and security design:

  &quot;Schedulers can be objectively tested. There's this thing called
  'performance', that can generally be quantified on a load basis.

  &quot;Yes, you can have crazy ideas in both schedulers and security. Yes, you can
  simplify both for a particular load. Yes, you can make mistakes in both. But
  the *discussion* on security seems to never get down to real numbers. So the
  difference between them is simple: one is 'hard science'. The other one is
  'people wanking around with their opinions'.&quot;
