The article is not real clear about the level of physical 
dissection actually used, but it does appear that progress is

[Moderator's note: the article discusses the cryptanalysis of the
algorithm used in the ill-fated Dutch transit card, which is also in
use in the London Underground's &quot;Oystercard&quot; -- actually
cryptanalysis, not mere brute force attack which was possible before. --Perry]
