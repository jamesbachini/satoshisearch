I could see where knowing what the license plate should be, from
the transponder code, could feed back into the OCR and only
generate a hit when the disagreement was obvious.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, they are using the transponder codes
to measure how fast traffic is moving from place to place. They
post the times to various destinations on the electric signs when
there are no Amber alerts or other more important things to
display. It is quite convenient, and they promise they don't use it
to track people's trips.

If one were paranoid, one could put a different ID into the
transponder for each trip, and only put the one it was issued with
into it for toll crossings. :-)
