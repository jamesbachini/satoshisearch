Isn't this vulnerability already in the Top 10, specifically &quot;A7 - Broken 
Authentication and Session Management&quot; (
<A HREF="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A7">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-A7</A>)?

&gt;<i>From the &quot;Protection&quot; section for A7:
</I>
&quot;Do not allow the login process to start from an unencrypted page. Always 
start the login process from a second, encrypted page with a fresh or new 
session token to prevent credential or session stealing, phishing attacks 
and session fixation attacks.&quot;
