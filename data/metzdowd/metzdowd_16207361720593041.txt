There are two major issues with DNSSEC right now. Neither of them is 
that it isn't working.

Firstly, the root is not signed. This means there's no easy way for the 
relying party to establish the correctness of the key on your domain.

Secondly, although we have DNS servers and resolvers, software that uses 
DNS is largely unaware of DNSSEC and so has absolutely no idea what to 
do when one of the many possible cryptographic/proof failures occurs. 
Very little thought has gone into what should be done, even in software 
that is aware.

That said, if you want to distribute keys with DNSSEC, then RFC 4398 
standardises ways to do a number of them, and can be extended to cover 
more. RFC 4255 gives you SSH host keys, too.

If you want to do something ad hoc, then there are always TXT records, 
though I guarantee this will make the DNS people hate you forever.

Cheers,

Ben.
