Does anybody have a recipe for this first mode handy?  plain text e- 
mails seem simple enough, but there needs to be a bit of MIME  
unwrapping and rewrapping to correctly handle attachments so that the  
client sees/decrypts them correctly I think.  I've searched from time  
to time and never found a good HowTo...

Thanks,
