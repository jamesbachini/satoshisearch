And -- turning the topic back to crypto -- is there a cryptographic
solution to license plates?  Put another way, what are the legitimate
needs of various parties, and can these be satisfied in a
privacy-preserving way?  (Note: I do not regard &quot;put a digital cash
wallet in the transponder&quot; as a solution to the license plate problem,
since it doesn't handle the problem of toll evaders, people who aren't
members of the system, and many other things that license plates are
used for.)
