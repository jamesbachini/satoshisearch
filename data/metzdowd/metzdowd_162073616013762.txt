 &gt; The obvious way - doing a specific step just to verify

 &gt; network protocol is a language in which a transmission
 &gt; is syntactically correct if and only if all the
 &gt; security properties hold. In some ways current
 &gt; protocols are like a poorly-written language whose
 &gt; parser that needs a seperator character between
 &gt; statements instead of being able to detect the syntax
 &gt; error when it starts processing the following
 &gt; statement.  Basically it lacks even a single symbol
 &gt; look-ahead.

SRP, as specified, validates that the shared secret on
both sides is the same, requiring an extra 0.5 RTT.  If
message validation depends on the entire shared secret,
then validating that they are identical is unnecessary.
