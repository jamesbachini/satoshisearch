If the affected software is doing DH with a malicious/compromised  
peer, the peer can make it arrive at a predictable secret -- which  
would be known to some passive listener. But hey, if the peer is  
malicious or compromised to begin with, it could just as well do DH  
normally and explicitly send the secret to the listener when it's  
done. Not much to see here.
