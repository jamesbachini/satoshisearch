How so? If your computer goes bad, you need a *backup*. That's  
entirely orthogonal to the drive encryption problem. Bitlocker uses  
the TPM to provide assurance that your drive -- really, volume -- is  
locked to your computer, and that the early boot environment hasn't  
been messed with. When either check fails, you use the BitLocker  
recovery password (either on a USB stick or entered manually) to  
recover your data. This holds in the event that you take your drive  
out and stick it in a different machine. In other words, the TPM is  
not a single point of failure, so I don't understand why you think  
you care about TPM backup/restore/transfer.

Security is never free, but in 2007, we can afford the cycles. What's  
a better use for them? Drawing semi-transparent stained glass window  
borders?
