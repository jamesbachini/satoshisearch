There is some hope that Bletchley Park may be able to get money from
the UK national lottery, which is used to fund cultural institutions,
but nothing is nailed down yet. They're also apparently selling old
roofing slates as a fundraiser (they've been replacing them in the
process of fixing leaks in the main building.)
