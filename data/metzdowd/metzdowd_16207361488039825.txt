<PRE>&gt;<i>I think you misread what I said about &quot;BIOS jumper required install&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>Ie this is not a one click install from email.  It is something one

If only.  If you can e-mail me a cool widget with directions I can
follow to install it, a virus can e-mail a million people a copy of
itself with installation instructions, too.  Passworded zip viruses
require considerable effort to install.  I was amazed how many people
do it.

Experience says that enough people will follow the instructions, no
matter how many dire warnings you give them, that anything that's user
programmable isn't a security device.
