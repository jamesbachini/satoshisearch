MBTA's claim was based on CFAA, the Computer Fraud and Abuse 
Act.  Properly, the judge decided (in effect) that CFAA only applies 
to messing with computers (a legal term of fanciful art), not to 
speaking about software that might mess with computers.

The more interesting question, which has not been addressed, is 
whether the CFAA definition of &quot;computer&quot; is so broad that it would 
include the CharlieCard and/or CharlieTicket.  The Complaint alleges 
specifically that both are computers.
