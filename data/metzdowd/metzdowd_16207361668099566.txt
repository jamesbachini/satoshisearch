If, as seems likely, we are moving into a world where virtual
machines are a popular security mechanism, the problem isn't
detecting if you are on a virtual machine, because all useful OSes
will expect to be running on a virtual machine.  The problem will be
to detect if the virtual machine is hostile.  That code will
probably have to be part of the virtual machine monitor (VMM)
implementation.  There may be less use for running VMMs in virtual
machines, although we got a lot of use from the ability to run
VM/370 in a VM/370 virtual machine back in the 70's and 80's.

Neat.  An interrupt at the wrong time would also upset the
TLB/Mapping table mismatch.  I wonder if a VMM could be built to
simulate the mismatch?  Note that on the Intel architecture, there
are certain instructions that behave differently in supervisor mode
and user mode.  These instructions can also be used to leverage VM
detection.
