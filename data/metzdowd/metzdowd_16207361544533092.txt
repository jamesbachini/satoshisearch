  Effectively, it's just an offload processor in fancy dress.

  It relies on diverting all your network traffic out to the USB and back just
before/after the NIC, which it presumably has to do with some sort of filter
driver, so it's subject to all the same problems vs. malware as any desktop
pfw.

  Unless your box is so overloaded that the pfw is starved of cpu cycles, I
can't see the use of it myself.

    cheers,
