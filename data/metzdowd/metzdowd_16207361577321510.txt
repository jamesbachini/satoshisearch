Sun's &quot;Secure NFS&quot; product from the 1980s had 192-bit Diffie-Hellman,
and a comment in one of the O'Reilly NFS books says that
         &quot;However, by 1990, advances in RISC processors produced
         workstation machines that could, by brute force,
         derive the private key from any public key in under a day.&quot;
but that in 1987 there were still a lot of Motorola 68010 machines
that took several minutes to generate keys so they didn't want it longer.
I'm guessing that a 1990 RISC machine was around 50 MIPS,
so it's maybe 1/100 the speed of a modern single-core CPU.

128-bit DH sounds like as good a decision as using 40-bit RC4 keys would be 
today.
