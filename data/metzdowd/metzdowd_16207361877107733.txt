When I joined Google over two years ago I was asked to find a small 
project to get used to the way development is done there. The project I 
chose was one that some colleagues had been thinking about, a key 
management library. I soon realised that unless the library also handled 
the crypto it was punting on the hard problem, so I extended it to do 
crypto and to handle key rotation and algorithm changes transparently to 
the user of the library.

About nine months later I handed over my &quot;starter project&quot; to Steve 
Weis, who has worked on it ever since. For a long time we've talked 
about releasing an open source version, and I'm pleased to say that 
Steve and intern Arkajit Dey did just that, earlier this week: Keyczar[1].

     &quot;Keyczar is an open source cryptographic toolkit designed to make 
it easier and safer for developers to use cryptography in their 
applications. Keyczar supports authentication and encryption with both 
symmetric and asymmetric keys. Some features of Keyczar include:

         * A simple API
         * Key rotation and versioning
         * Safe default algorithms, modes, and key lengths
         * Automated generation of initialization vectors and ciphertext 
signatures&quot;

When we say simple, by the way, the code for loading a keyset and 
encrypting some plaintext is just two lines. Likewise for decryption. 
And the user doesn't need to know anything about algorithms or modes.

Great work, guys! I look forward to the &quot;real&quot; version (C++, of course!).
