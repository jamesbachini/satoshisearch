It might have been secure enough back in the days before almost every
machine was infected by things like drive-by malware. Now that the
hardware the user is on can no longer be trusted, this would only
raise the bar slightly, and cause the bad guys, who already own half
the machines on the net, to work a few more hours.

I won't say such a thing would be bad if it already existed, but it
seems like it would no longer be enough.
