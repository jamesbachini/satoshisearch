that was one of the business case problems early in SSL for
electronic commerce ... namely majority of ecommerce was
with repeat sites ... while design point of digital certificates
is for first time communication between strangers.

the other factor that bounded what merchants would pay
was liability in electronic commerce ... there were already
paying significant interchange fees as part of protecting
the consumer. certification authorities weren't looking
at taking on any of that aspect.

the combination has been pushing digital certificates
into the no-value market segment ... which, in turn,
further limits what would could be charged for.
