Dear Colleague,

This is a call for *** posters and panel *** submissions (published
in proceedings) for the Financial Cryptography and Data Security
Conference in Cozumel, Mexico, 28-31 January, 2008
(<A HREF="http://fc08.ifca.ai">http://fc08.ifca.ai</A>). Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a
major international forum for research, advanced development,
education, exploration, and debate regarding information assurance in
the context of finance and commerce. The conference covers all
aspects of securing transactions and systems. Submissions focusing on
both fundamental and applied real-world deployments are solicited.

Accepted 1 page poster summaries will be published in the proceedings ! 
The poster session is the perfect venue to share a provocative
opinion, interesting established or preliminary work, or a cool idea
that will spark discussion. Poster presenters will benefit from a
multi-hour session to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive
feedback from attendees.

Free Child Care

We are also happy to offer free child care as part of the conference.
The hotel offers a kids' club, with supervised childcare and
activities from 9am to 5pm for children of age 5-12 whose parents are
somewhere on the premises (in the conference room is fine). This is
free of charge for hotel guests. Baby-sitting is available for US$5
per child per hour. Additionally, as part of the room rate for
conference attendees, children of age 0-12 are free of charge
(including food).

Financial Assistance for Primary Care Giver

We will also provide financial assistance to a scholar who is a
primary care giver, and who has their research paper accepted for
presentation. $750 will be awarded to pay for childcare and other
family-related expenses related to attending the conference.
