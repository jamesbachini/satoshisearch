<PRE>Perhaps I'm missing something, but real-world RSA implementations are
not vulnerable to this because they implement RSA blinding to prevent
timing attacks (which prevents a magic a * b fault from being exploited
deterministically) or verify the signature after creation (which
protects against random faults, a very good idea anyway).

Something can't be &quot;new&quot; and &quot;big&quot; if it's been addressed in GnuPG,
Crypto++ and others years ago. 8-P
