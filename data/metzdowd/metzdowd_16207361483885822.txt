Such a device was actually manufactured in Europe in the late 1990s,
unfortunately they couldn't find any bank willing to pay the cost, and it was
discontinued.  Similar devices are still being made for some vertical-market
applications, but they're sold at astronomical prices.

Given that all you need for this is a glorified pocket calculator, you could
(in large enough quantities) probably get it made for &lt; $10, provided you shot
anyone who tried to introduce product-deployment DoS mechanisms like smart
cards and EMV into the picture.  Now all we need to do is figure out how to
get there from here.
