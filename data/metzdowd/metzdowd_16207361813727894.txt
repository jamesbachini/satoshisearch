Not so fast. Bank PINs are usually just 4 numeric characters long and 
yet they are considered /safe/ even for web access to the account 
(where a physical card is not required).

Why? Because after 4 tries the access is blocked for your IP number 
(in some cases after 3 tries).

The question is not only how many combinations you have but also how 
much time you need to try enough combinations so that you can succeed.

I'm not defending the designers of that email system, as I do not know 
any specifics -- I'm just pointing out that what you mention is not 
necessarily a problem and may be even safer than secure online banking 
today.
