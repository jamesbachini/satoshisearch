 From the viewpoint of the user (which is the viewpoint used by 
Kelly), we see that trust can be copied when different users, 
accessing different servers for the same domain, do not know that they 
are using different copies of the /same/ SSL cert. In fact, no copy is 
less of an original than the original itself!

We see that the trust relationship represented by that SSL cert can be 
copied without any loss, as many times as you wish (for the possible 
dismay of the CA). If the CA bit is set, trust can even be transferred 
to multiple domains, and the trust represented by each such SSL cert 
in each domain can be copied without limit as well.

As to another point of your comment, the problem most people have with 
PKI is not that SSL does not work. SSL does not even need PKI.

The problem can be explained in terms of extent of trust. If you don't 
define your extent of trust in a CA, for example in your acceptance 
policy of records signed by certs from a CA, you may run into 
difficulties. The difficulties are /solved/ (within your risk model) 
when you correctly define the extent of trust -- rather than just 
taking a &quot;trust in all matters&quot; attitude.

For example, even though I do not trust a CA's CRLs, I may trust that 
CA to prevent rogue use of its private-key for signing end-user certs. 
This trust, limited by this extent, can be used in automating use of 
certs from that CA -- for example, only accept signatures from 
end-user certs of that CA if the cert is less than 31 days old (or, 15 
days -- whatever your risk model says).
