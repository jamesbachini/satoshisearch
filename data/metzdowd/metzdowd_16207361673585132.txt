<PRE>Hi Folks,

&gt;<i> Ed Felten has an interesting post on his blog about a Dutch smartcard
</I>&gt;<i> based transportation payment system that has been broken. Among other
</I>&gt;<i> foolishness, the designers used a custom cryptosystem and 48 bit keys.
</I>
Not to defend the designers in any way or fashion, but I'd like to  
ask, How much security can you put into a plastic card, the size of a  
credit card, that has to perform its function in a secure manner, all  
in under 2 seconds (in under 1 second in parts of Asia)? And it has to  
do this while receiving its power via the electromagnetic field being  
generated by the reader.

Regards,
Aram Perez
