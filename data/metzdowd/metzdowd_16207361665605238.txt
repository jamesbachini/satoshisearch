The wider point of Peter's writeup -- and of the therapy -- is that  
developers working on security tools should _know_ they're working in  
a notoriously, infamously hard field where the odds are  
_overwhelmingly_ against them if they choose to engineer new solutions.

With such understanding, no competent developer should ever set out to  
build new cryptosystems unless he can explain, point by point, why his  
needs cannot be met by existing, vetted systems. That explanation  
should ideally be made public for dissection by the community.
