  Out of curiosity, what kind of TCP are you guys using that has 8-bit
checksums?

  Is it not also worth mentioning that TCP has some added degree of protection
in that if the ACK sequence num isn't right, the packet is likely to be
dropped (or just break the stream altogether by desynchronising the seqnums)?
