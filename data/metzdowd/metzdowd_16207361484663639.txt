I think this is a slight overstatement.

If security on login connections was expensive, difficult, or not part
of the common infrastructure, everyone would still be using plaintext
passwords over telnet. However, ssh is just as easy or in fact easier
to use then telnet/ftp/etc., so that it has become
ubiquitous.

If using secure phones was as cheap and easy as using insecure ones,
everyone would do it. They just won't go out of their way to do
it. The market will happily accept a new feature that is free and
zero complexity in use. It is well within technical possibility to
create such a thing -- the issue is purely political.
