This too is dealt with. Message sizes are bounded, recipient counts
are bounded, duplicate elimination cache sizes are bounded, command
lengths are bounded, logical header lengths are bounded, body content
is processed 2K bytes at a time...

The requirement is stronger than just not running a single process out of
memory, the entire multi-process Postfix is designed to run in (realistic)
bounded memory (no &quot;fork: out of memory&quot;).
