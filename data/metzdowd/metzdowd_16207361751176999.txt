I was reminded of the same contest[0]. The winning date-agnostic  
entry[1] was by Micha&#322; Zalewski[2], and is nothing short of evil. I  
spotted the problem after staring at the code intensely for about a  
half hour, knowing in advance it was there. Had I not known, I don't  
think I'd have found it.
