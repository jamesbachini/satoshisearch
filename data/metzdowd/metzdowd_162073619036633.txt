Clarification: not the study.

I believe the article had an inappropriate tone. Calling victims of
inadequate user interfaces &quot;idiots&quot; is inappropriate and spits in the
face of the evidence.

It's still a fact that when a majority of a population of operators of  
any
equipment is experiencing poor outcomes just using it as normal
people do, then there is a screaming need to fix that equipment.

If the &quot;blame the idiot&quot; thinking were accepted in other domains, we'd
still have factory workers chopping off their limbs on a daily basis  
because
any non-idiot should be smart enough to step back when the press
is coming down. The simple fact is that normal people make mistakes and
experience momentary slips as part of their ordinary existence.

It's a designer's job to consider the users of an engineered device, to
consider what their /entirely expected/ failings will be, and to work
to prevent them. The current approaches do not work well to prevent
the expected human failures.

Therefore, the current approaches are inadequate.

The study suggests that people should be expected to make errors using
current user interfaces shoved in their faces by the stuff behind the
scenes that never should have been so insecure in the first place.
Why all the shock and outrage then?

Security and OS builders would do well to consider how nuanced certain
other things are, that &quot;just work right&quot;. As a quick example, I've not
looked at the code but i can definitely tell that a hell of a lot of
scrubbing is done on the trackpad inputs from this laptop, so that
cursor motion is reliable and predictable, despite my imprecise finger
movements. I look forward to seeing such nuance in user safety
someday and will never be satisfied calling the majority of the  
population
&quot;idiots&quot; because some human-built device has gotten lots of them
into unexpected trouble.

Human factors haven't received nearly enough attention, and as long as
human factors failings are dismissed as the fault of &quot;idiot users&quot;, they
never will.
