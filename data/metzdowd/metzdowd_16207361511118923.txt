The Steam survey is going to overestimate the power of the average
machine because it is only sampling machines which are capable of
playing Half-Life 2 (or other equally resource intensive games). The
recommended machine for Half-Life 2 is a 2.4 GHz CPU with 512 Mbytes
RAM. No surprise that most of the machines surveyed hit that minimum.

As for &quot;most powerful supercomputer&quot; - that ignores that the
interconnect used (the Internet) is going to be 2 to 4 orders of
magnitude slower in bandwidth and latency than that used in any modern
supercomputer.
