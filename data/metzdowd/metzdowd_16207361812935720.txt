I doubt there'll ever be much demand. The tinfoil hat crowd will be  
bothered by the n-1 hops (and however many Narus boxes in between)  
being traversed unencrypted, while most everyone else seemingly  
doesn't care and uses GMail/Hotmail/YahooMail, forfeiting any  
expectation of privacy right from the start.

The easiest thing for people who _do_ care is still running their own  
mail server. The emergence of reasonably priced VM hosting providers  
(e.g. slicehost.com) makes it fairly uncomplicated, modulo initial  
setup.
