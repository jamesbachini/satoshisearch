&quot;Beating Colossus: an interview with Joachim Schueth

Joachim Schueth has beaten a reconstruction of the famous Colossus Mark 
II code breaking machine in November 2007. The Colossus computers were 
used in World War II to break the German encrypted messages. Equipped 
with a NetBSD-powered laptop and profound knowledge of cryptography and 
the Ada programming language, Schueth has won the code-cracking 
challenge. We talked with him about the historical and technical 
backgrounds of the Cipher Event and the tools he has used.&quot;
