This p is a &quot;strong&quot; prime, one where (p-1)/2 is also a prime, a good
property for a DH modulus. The generator g=2 generates the entire group,
which is an OK choice. It means that one bit of the shared secret is
leaked (whether or not it is a quadratic residue, i.e. whether the
discrete log of the number is even or odd). But that shouldn't matter,
the shared secret should be hashed and/or used as the seed of a PRNG to
generate further keys.

The main problem as I said is that 1024 bit moduli are no longer
considered sufficiently safe for more than casual purposes. Particularly
with discrete logs that use a widely-shared modulus like the one above,
it would not be surprising to see it publicly broken in the next 5-10
years, or perhaps even sooner. And if a public effort can accomplish it
in a few years, conservatively we should assume that well funded secret
efforts could already succeed today.
