I would like to see some facts to support the assertion that the &quot;idea that SSL/TLS and 
port 587 are somehow able to prevent warrantless wiretapping&quot; is &quot;often expressed&quot;.

A Google search for
  ssl &quot;port 587&quot; warrantless wiretapping
got exactly one hit, which was your posting to the mailing list where it had been archived 
on security-basic.blogspot.com and snarfed up by Google within the hour.

remarkable update to their search engine).
