<PRE>As promised a couple of weeks ago, the public review of SKSML has
begun.  The OASIS EKMI Technical Committee would be grateful for any
comments received from members of this forum about the key-management 
protocol.

If you are interested in reviewing a working implementation of an early
version of this protocol, you can get the implementation here; some of 
the features of the specification as described in the OASIS document
are not yet implemented in this software, but there is enough to give
interested people a clear understanding of its capabilities, strengths
and potential weaknesses:

Looking forward to this groups' comments.  Thank you.

Abstract:
This normative specification defines the first (1.0) version of the Symmetric
Key Services Markup Language (SKSML), an XML-based messaging protocol, by which
applications executing on computing devices may request and receive symmetric
key-management services from centralized key-management servers, securely, over
networks. Applications using SKSML are expected to either implement the SKSML
protocol, or use a software library - called the Symmetric Key Client Library
(SKCL) - that implements this protocol. SKSML messages are transported within a
SOAP layer, protected by a Web Services Security (WSS) header and can be used
over standard HTTP securely.

OASIS and the EKMI TC welcome your comments.
