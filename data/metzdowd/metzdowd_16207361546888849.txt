ACNS 2008: CALL FOR PAPERS
--------------------------

6th International Conference on
Applied Cryptography and Network Security

<A HREF="http://acns2008.cs.columbia.edu/">http://acns2008.cs.columbia.edu/</A>

Location:            Columbia University, New York City, USA
Date:                June 3-6, 2008
Submission Deadline: 14 January 2008 23:59:59 EST
Author Notification: 14 March 2008

General Chairs:      Angelos Keromytis &amp; Moti Yung
Program Chairs:      Steven Bellovin &amp; Rosario Gennaro
Publicity Chair:     Jianying Zhou


[TOPICS]

Original papers on all aspects of applied cryptography and network
security are solicited for submission to ACNS'08. Topics of relevance
include but are not limited to:

* Applied cryptography and provably-secure cryptographic protocols
* Design and analysis of efficient cryptographic primitives: public-key
  and symmetric-key cryptosystems, block ciphers, and hash functions
* Network security protocols
* Techniques for anonymity; trade-offs between anonymity and utility
* Integrating security into the next-generation Internet: DNS security,
  routing, naming, denial-of-service attacks, TCP/IP, secure multicast
* Economic fraud on the Internet: phishing, pharming, spam, and click
  fraud
* Email and web security
* Public key infrastructure, key management, certification, and
  revocation
* Security and privacy for emerging technologies: sensor networks,
  mobile (ad hoc) networks, peer-to-peer networks, bluetooth, 802.11,
  RFID
* Trust metrics and robust trust inference in distributed systems
* Security and usability
* Intellectual property protection: metering, watermarking, and
  digital rights management
* Modeling and protocol design for rational and malicious adversaries
* Automated analysis of protocols

Papers suggesting novel paradigms, original directions, or
non-traditional perspectives are especially welcome.

As in previous years, there will be an academic track and an industrial
track. Submissions to the academic track should emphasize research
contributions, while submissions to the industrial track may focus on
implementation and deployment of real-world systems. Submissions for the
industrial track must clearly indicate this in the title. Proceedings
for the academic track will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture
Notes in Computer Science and will be available at the conference.
Papers accepted to the industrial track will be published in a different
venue.

[AUTHOR INSTRUCTIONS]

Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations,
acknowledgments, or obvious references. Submissions should be in
English, in PDF format with all fonts embedded, typeset with 11pt font
or larger, and using reasonable spacing and margins. They should not
exceed 12 letter-sized pages, not counting the bibliography and
appendices. Papers should begin with a title, abstract, and an
introduction that clearly summarizes the contributions of the paper at a
level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Papers should contain a
scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including
motivation, relevance to practical applications, and a clear comparison
with related work. Committee members are not required to read
appendices, and papers should be intelligible without them. Submitted
papers risk being rejected without consideration of their merits if they
do not follow all the above guidelines.

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that was published
elsewhere, or work that any of the authors has submitted in parallel to
any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. Plagiarism and
double submissions will be dealt with harshly.

Authors will be asked to indicate whether their submissions should be
considered for the best student paper award; any paper co-authored by a
full-time student is eligible for this award.

Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be
presented at the conference.
