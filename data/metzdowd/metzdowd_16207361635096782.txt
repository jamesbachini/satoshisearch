I don't but my many over-70 relatives all have
some sort of e-mail now, many from AOL where
we know from history the price of buying the
AOL screenames in bulk from an insider was at
the rate of $0.001/name.

Quoting my friend Marcus Ranum, the Internet
will remain as insecure as it can and still
apparently function.  Why should voting be
different?

We are approaching a rat hole...
