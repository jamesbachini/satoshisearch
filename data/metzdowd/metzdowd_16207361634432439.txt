<PRE>Hi William,

&gt;<i> &gt; ... We say so on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the website. We did show this hiding of collisions for other data 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formats, such as X.509 certificates
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More interesting.  Where on your web site?  I've long abhorred the
</I>&gt;<i> X.509 format, and was a supporter of a more clean alternative.
</I>
See <A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/">http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; Our real work is chosen-prefix collisions combined with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multi-collisions. This is crypto, it has not been done before,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly it was done before! 
</I>
I was referring to MD5. Apart from that, I'd be interested in
seeing references to older work on chosen-prefix multicollisions.

&gt;<i> What *would* be crypto is the quantification of where MDx 
</I>&gt;<i> currently falls on the computational spectrum.
</I>
Our first chosen-prefix collision attack has complexity of about
2^50, as described in our EuroCrypt 2007 paper. This has been 
considerably improved since then. In the full paper that is in
preparation we'll give details of those improvements.

Grtz,
Benne
