&quot;Ann Arbor (MI) - University of Michigan scientists have discovered a
breakthrough way to utilize light in cryptography. The new technique
can crack even complex codes in a matter of seconds. Scientists believe
this technique offers much advancement over current solutions and could
serve to foil national and personal security threats if employed.&quot;...

I'll let those who know more physics comment in detail; from reading
the article, it appears to lead to a way to construct quantum computers.
