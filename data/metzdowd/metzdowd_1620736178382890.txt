&gt;<i> I can't think of a great way of alerting the user,
</I>
I would be alerted immediately, because I'm using the Petname Tool Firefox 
plugin.

For an unproxied site, I get a small green window with my own choice of text in 
it (e.g. &quot;Gmail&quot; if I'm visiting <A HREF="https://mail.google.com">https://mail.google.com</A>). If a proxy were to 
insert itself in the middle, that window would turn yellow, and the message 
would change to &quot;(untrusted)&quot;.
