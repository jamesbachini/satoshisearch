A great product, but not an FDE one.

It encrypts contents of logical drives into container files. You still
have to worry about temp files, swap files, hibernation files, tampering
with the OS when you're away, etc.

FDE typically authenticates pre-OS-boot and supports the encryption of
the full disk, including the OS, applications, system storage areas, etc.
