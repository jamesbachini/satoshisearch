Huh?  Have you got a source for that?  This is he first time I've
heard of such claims.

Message submission over 587/TCP gives the receiver more leeway
regarding adjusting message contents to police (add a message ID,
check the Date and From headers, and so on).  The abuse management
contract is also different: once you accept a message over 587/TCP,
it's your fault (and your fault alone) if this message turns out to be
spam.  There's nothing related to confidentiality that I know of.
