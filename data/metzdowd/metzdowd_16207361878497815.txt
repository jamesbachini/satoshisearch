Why do you say a couple of megabytes? 99% of the value would be
1024-bit RSA keys. There are ~32,000 such keys. If you devote an
80-bit hash to each one (which is easily large enough to give you a
vanishingly small false positive probability; you could probably get
away with 64 bits), that's 320KB.  Given that the smallest Firefox
build (Windows) is 7.1 MB, this doesn't sound like a nonstarter to me
at all, especially since the browser could download it in the
background.

Yes, there are a number of approaches to more efficient CRL
checking, I think that's a separate issue.
