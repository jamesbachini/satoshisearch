BTW the original quote seems to be:

&quot;Secure web servers are the equivalent of heavy armored cars. The 
problem is, they are being used to transfer rolls of coins and checks 
written in crayon by people on park benches to merchants doing business 
in cardboard boxes from beneath highway bridges. Further, the roads are 
subject to random detours, anyone with a screwdriver can control the 
traffic lights, and there are no police.&quot;
