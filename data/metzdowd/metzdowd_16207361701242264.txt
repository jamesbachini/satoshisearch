That's just plain factually wrong. DTLS does fine for that purpose. At
the point where you are sending datagrams with voice data, you're just
doing conventional crypto over a fixed length packet each time, and
those algorithms are quite deterministic.

Indeed, DTLS was designed specifically for such applications.
