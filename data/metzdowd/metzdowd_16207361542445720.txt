<PRE>There are pdf viewers and pdf image and text extraction tools for
various platforms that allow you to extract content despite the
document Security Methods specification of Document Restrictions. 
Failing that you could always do screen grabs and Optical Character
Recognition.

DRM failing because they let people actually see their super-Sekrets.

Saw a fun one recently, watermarks whose text becomes opaque after
printing once.  Gee, you make the file ugo-w, or should you start
looking out for signs of a root kit?
