I have little experience on the embedded crypto side but I do maintain
a crypto library that has some non-zero number of users on general
desktop and server machines.

Basic protections ala your point 2 are provided and enabled by default
(blinding, and checking private key operations for consistency with
the public, to prevent the really easy attacks). There used to be a
toggle to disable blinding, which as far as I know was never used - or
at least nobody complained when I removed the toggle.

To my memory nobody has ever asked about what SCA measures are or are
not enabled, or how to toggle them, though I do have a FAQ entry about
it, so perhaps people who really wanted serious side-channel
resistence just read that FAQ and moved on to another implementation
without ever bothering to contact me - certainly there are some
self-selection problems with my sampling.

When FlexSecure wrote Botan's ECC implementation for BSI, they
implemented a number of anti-timing attack countermeasures - but they
were being paid to care about that, so this is probably not a valid
datapoint.
