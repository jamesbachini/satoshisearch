public key operation in various standards, notably in the financial 
industry.

Thanks for reporting those.

No doubt that certificateless public key operation is neither new nor 
absence from today's scene.

The document I published on my web site today is focused on fielding 
certificateless public operations with the TLS protocol which does not 
support client public keys without certificates - hence the meaningless 
security certificate. Nothing fancy in this technique, just a small 
contribution with the hope to facilitate the use of client-side PKC.
