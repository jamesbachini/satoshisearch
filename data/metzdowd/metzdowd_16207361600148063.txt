<PRE>A random thought that's been kicking around in my head: if someone were
looking for a project, an open-source permissive action link (
<A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/nsam-160/pal.html">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/nsam-160/pal.html</A> is a good link, thank you
Mr. Bellovin) seems like it might be a great public resource: I suspect it's
something that some nuclear states could use some education on, but even if
the US is willing to share technology, the recipient may not really trust
the source.

As such, an open-source PAL technology might substantially improve global
safety.

Thoughts?
