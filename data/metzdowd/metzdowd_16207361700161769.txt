That's actually a sad observation.

I keep telling my colleagues that this technology is coming &quot;any day
now&quot; to a browser near you - didn't realize that that there was no
interest with the browser companies to add support for this...

Why do the browser companies not care?
What is the adoption issue?
Still the dark cloud of patents looming over it?
Not enough understanding about the benefits? (marketing)
Economic reasons that we wouldn't buy anymore server certs?
