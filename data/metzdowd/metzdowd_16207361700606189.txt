No, it just requires that the computer was recently turned on. It need
not have been &quot;unlocked&quot; -- it jut needed to have keying material in RAM.

LN2 is pretty trivial to get your hands on, and will remain happy and
liquid in an ordinary thermos for quite some hours or longer. However,
the authors point out that canned air works fine, too.

&gt;<i> And the attacker has to do all this in less then 2 seconds.... :)
</I>
No, they may even have minutes depending on the RAM you have.

&gt;<i> Or am I missing something?
</I>
People readily assume that rebooting or turning off a computer wipes
RAM. It doesn't. This is just more evidence that it is bad
to assume that the contents of RAM are gone even if you turn off the
machine.
