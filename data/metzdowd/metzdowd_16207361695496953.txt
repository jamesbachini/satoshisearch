While there's an obvious interpretation of that (&quot;Microsoft want to lock
everyone into CardSpace&quot;), there's a second interpretation that's equally
likely: After &gt; 10 years of effort and getting almost exactly nowhere with
client certs, Microsoft are moving on to something more likely to succeed
(actually I have no idea how workable CardSpace is since I don't think
anyone's done any usability studies on it, but I doubt it's more unworkable
than client certs.  Is anyone aware of any third-party usability studies on
CardSpace, OpenID, ...?).

&gt;<i>But how do you sign your emails with CardSpace?
</I>
Does anyone care that you can't sign your emails with CardSpace?

(I could post my standard reference on this here again :-).  The unwashed
masses don't even know what signed email is, let alone care about using it.  I
know that there are assorted corporates and so on that are still keen on email
signing, but they can keep playing with PKI for that.  CardSpace/Liberty/
OpenID/SAML/whatever[0] should handle the rest.

Eventually.

[0] I'm not sure whether putting &quot;CardSpace&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; in such close
    proximity in the above line was a good idea.  If your monitor starts 
    smoking due to the friction generated, please cut&amp;paste one of the two 
    elsewhere.
