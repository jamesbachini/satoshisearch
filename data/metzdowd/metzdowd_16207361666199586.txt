That's not practical. If you're a large online merchant, and your
automated systems are picking up lots of fraud, you want an automated
system for reporting it. Having a team of people on the phone 24x7
talking to your acquirer and reading them credit card numbers over the
phone, and then expecting the acquirer to do something with them when
they don't have an automated system either, is just not reasonable.
