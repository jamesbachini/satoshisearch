An except from my recent blog post:

Now, this topic is not new. Bruce Schneier wrote about it a few years  
ago [2]. Schneier says that he &#8220;type[s] a completely random answer,&#8221;  
but consider this anecdote: a colleague of mine uses the same  
technique. He called up customer service once, who then asked him,  
&#8220;what&#8217;s the answer to your security question?&#8221; He said, &#8220;some random  
numbers.&#8221; The response was &#8220;okay.&#8221; So picking random numbers might be  
less secure than picking a realistic answer? :-)
