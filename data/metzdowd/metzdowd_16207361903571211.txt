As the service provider you have little choice but to assume local
security on the client side IF you want to allow clients that you don't
control (and you don't really have a choice about _that_; most SPs don't
anyways).

I don't see how to mitigate all possible attacks you can imagine that
involve a compromised client.

You could say the same thing about AJAX, ...  This train left the
station long ago, and I was on it then along with everyone else.
