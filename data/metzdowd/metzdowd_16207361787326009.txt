I'm one of those people who uses OpenVPN instead of IPSEC, and I'm one
of the people who helped create IPSEC.

Right now, to use SSH to remotely connect to a machine using public
keys, all I have to do is type &quot;ssh-keygen&quot; and copy the locally
generated public key to a remote machine's authorized keys file.
When there is an IPSEC system that is equally easy to use I'll switch
to it.

Until then, OpenVPN let me get started in about five minutes, and the
fact that it is less than completely secure doesn't matter much to me
as I'm running SSH under it anyway.
