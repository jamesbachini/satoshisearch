&gt;<i> I will be presenting /some/ of this work at Toorcon in San Diego this

excellent, how'd it go? Anyone else present on Storm?



&gt;<i> The presentation is not academic paper quality and takes more of a
</I>&gt;<i> code-monkey approach to the network.  Real (sane and substantiated) numbers,
</I>&gt;<i> stats, and graphs will be presented.  To the best of my knowledge, it will be
</I>&gt;<i> the first publicly released estimates of the size of the network with actual
</I>&gt;<i> supporting data and evidence.

are your slides now available?
