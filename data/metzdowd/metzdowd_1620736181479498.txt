  Why are we wasting time even considering trying to break the public key?

  If this thing generates only a single &quot;session&quot; key (rather, a host key)
per machine, then why is it not trivial to break?  The actual encryption
algorithm used is RC4, so if they're using a constant key without a unique
IV per file, it should be trivial to reconstruct the keystream by XORing any
two large files that have been encrypted by the virus on the same machine.

  This thing ought to be as easy as WEP to break open, shouldn't it?

    cheers,
