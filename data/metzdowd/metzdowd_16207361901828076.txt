Another option would be to use noise.  If you have a webcam, you also
have some sort of sound input usually.  Crappy microphones will give you
all sorts of hashable input.  (My non-webcam enabled laptop has two tiny
microphones above the screen.  It would be good to put them to some
use...)  And is it every truly quiet?  Not certain how long of a sample
you would need.  I suspect not that long.
