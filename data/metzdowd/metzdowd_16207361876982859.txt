I do not dispute this.

The point is I found OpenID servers with weak keys.

&gt;<i> The problem of weak keys should be dealt at the CA level, many which have

Indeed.

&gt;<i> We have spotted other actual problems in other services. Details will

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's superfluous to single out different services since any service

</I>
If you have a better forum, bring it on.

However, CAs do not have everything at their disposal to remove the
threat. Browsers,OpenID libraries and RPs must also participate.

Just as saying &quot;buffer overflows are bad&quot; has not magically caused all
buffer overflows to be fixed, I am confident that the only way to get
this problem fixed is to chase down all the culprits individually. I
am sure that OpenID is not the only thing with problems, as you say.
