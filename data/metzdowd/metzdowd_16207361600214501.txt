Subject: NIST announces approval of SP 800-38D specifying GCM


FYI, yesterday NIST announced the approval of Special Publication
800-38D, which specifies Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), an AES mode of
operation for authenticated encryption with associated data.  GCM was
submitted to NIST by David McGrew and John Viega.  The announcement
appears on the NIST website, at <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/">http://csrc.nist.gov/</A> , and the URL for
the document is <A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-38D">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-38D</A> .
