Sorry - but something like AES(static-key) encrypt of i++ or SHA1(i++)  
will pass each and everyone of those test very nicely - but with a bit  
of code or silicon peeking - one can probably 'break' this with  
relative ease.

I fail to see how you could evaluate this without seeing the code (and  
even then - I doubt that one can properly do this -- the ?old? NSA  
habit of tweaking your random generated rather than your protocol/ 
algorithm when they wanted your produced upgraded to export quality -  
is terribly effective and very hard to spot).

Or am I missing something ?
