The best figure I obtain on an AMD64 system is 11 cycles/byte, which
matches your results (you had me worried for a while with 9 cycles/byte!)

To go 5 times faster than this would mean close to 2 cycles/byte, a
speed that I find hard to believe without hardware acceleration

But a fully byte oriented implementation runs at about 140 cycles/byte
and here the S-Box substitution step is a significant bottleneck.  I too
think the PPERM instruction could be used for this and it seems possible
that this would produce large savings.  So 30 cycles/byte might well be
achievable in this case.

I hence wonder whether this is the comparison that AMD are making.

It is also possible that the PPERM instruction could be used to speed up
the Galois field calculations to produce the S-Box mathematically rather
than by table lookup. I have tried this in the past but it has not
proved competitive.  But PPERM looks interesting here as well.
