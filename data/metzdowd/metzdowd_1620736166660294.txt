<PRE>Oberthur Card Systems has a card designed for transit use with 3DES,
according to their datasheet (registration required,
<A HREF="http://www.oberthurcs.com/get_downloadsection_file.aspx?id=43&amp;otherid=95&amp;typ">http://www.oberthurcs.com/get_downloadsection_file.aspx?id=43&amp;otherid=95&amp;typ</A>
eid=5) it's certainly fast enough.

Interestingly, they also make the card that's failed so spectacularly
here...

Asunto: Re: Dutch Transport Card Broken

Hi Folks,

&gt;<i> Ed Felten has an interesting post on his blog about a Dutch smartcard
</I>&gt;<i> based transportation payment system that has been broken. Among other
</I>&gt;<i> foolishness, the designers used a custom cryptosystem and 48 bit keys.
</I>
Not to defend the designers in any way or fashion, but I'd like to  
ask, How much security can you put into a plastic card, the size of a  
credit card, that has to perform its function in a secure manner, all  
in under 2 seconds (in under 1 second in parts of Asia)? And it has to  
do this while receiving its power via the electromagnetic field being  
generated by the reader.

Regards,
Aram Perez
