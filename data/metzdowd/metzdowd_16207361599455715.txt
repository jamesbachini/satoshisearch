What about deleting the private key periodically?

Like issue one pgp sub-key per month, make sure it has expiry date etc
appropriately, and the sending client will be smart enough to not use
expired keys.

Need support for that kind of thing in the PGP clients.

And hope your months key expires before the lawyers get to it.

Companies have document retention policies for stuff like
this... dictating that data with no current use be deleted within some
time-period to avoid subpoenas reaching back too far.
