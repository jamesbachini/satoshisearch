The phrase is &quot;tamper resistant&quot;, not &quot;tamper proof&quot;. Depending on how
determined your attackers are, pretty much anything depending on
tamper resistant hardware will fall. As always, the question is
whether what you are protecting is worth more than the attackers would
have to spend on the attack.
