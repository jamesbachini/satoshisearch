What you mean, &quot;We?&quot;

I said ages ago that you cannot produce trust with cryptography, no  
matter how much cryptography you use. That's a bow towards Lao Tzu's  
original, &quot;you cannot produce kindness with cruelty, no matter how  
much cruelty you use.&quot;

To quote Crispin Cowan on phishing, it (and other con jobs) are a  
security failure on the device that sits between the keyboard and  
chair. Until we can issue patches on that device, we're getting  
nowhere. Even after, it's a long road ahead. I think you can prove  
that it's impossible to stop cons.

What we *can* do is lower the number of them. But we're not going to  
get anywhere when we blame the victims. I'm with Jim Youll on this,  
the people who think the users are idiots just don't get it.
