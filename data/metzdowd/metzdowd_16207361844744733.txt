Many German savings banks use account numbers as account names (see,  
e.g., <A HREF="https://bankingportal.stadtsparkasse-kaiserslautern.de/banking/">https://bankingportal.stadtsparkasse-kaiserslautern.de/banking/</A>) <A HREF="http://www.stadtsparkasse-kaiserslautern.de">http://www.stadtsparkasse-kaiserslautern.de</A> 
), as does, for example, the Saarl&#228;ndische Landesbank (<A HREF="https://banking.saarlb.de/cgi/anfang.cgi">https://banking.saarlb.de/cgi/anfang.cgi</A> 
). Most will not use 4-digit PINs, though.

Do you mean TANs (TransAction Numbers)? TANs are used to authorize  
transactions that could affect your account balance.  So stealing the  
PIN will let you look at the balance, but will not let you steal money  
(through this channel).

(Or maybe you knew all this already and I just missed the irony.)

Fun,
