There are now a number of drives on the market advertising AES based
FDE in hardware, and a number of laptops available on the market that
claim to support them.

Has anyone had any real-world experience with these yet? Are there
standards for how they get the keys from the BIOS or OS? (I'm
interested in how they deal with zeroization on sleep and such.)
Lastly, anyone have any idea of whether the manufacturers are doing
the encryption correctly or not?
