<PRE>In as much as good key management is fundamental to cryptography 
functioning appropriately I think that this is a good time for a 
peek at the proposed standard to find the holes before we wind up 
b$%^&amp;ing about how badly it was and trying to figure out how to get 
out from the hole that was dug because of a lack of oversight by the 
general cryptography community.

To OASIS members, Public Announce Lists:

The OASIS Enterprise Key Management Infrastructure (EKMI) TC has 
recently approved the following specification as a Committee Draft 
and approved the package for public review:

Symmetric Key Services Markup Language (SKSML) Version 1.0

The public review starts today, 24 July 2008, and ends 23 September 
2008. This is an open invitation to comment. We strongly encourage 
feedback from potential users, developers and others, whether OASIS 
members or not, for the sake of improving the interoperability and 
quality of OASIS work. Please feel free to distribute this 
announcement within your organization and to other appropriate
mail lists.

Abstract:
This normative specification defines the first (1.0) version of the 
Symmetric Key Services Markup Language (SKSML), an XML-based 
messaging protocol, by which applications executing on computing 
devices may request and receive symmetric key-management services 
from centralized key-management servers, securely, over networks. 
Applications using SKSML are expected to either implement the SKSML
protocol, or use a software library - called the Symmetric Key 
Client Library (SKCL) - that implements this protocol. SKSML 
messages are transported within a SOAP layer, protected by a Web 
Services Security (WSS) header and can be used over standard HTTP 
securely.

OASIS and the EKMI TC welcome your comments.
