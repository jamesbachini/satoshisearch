</I>This is an old technique.  We could even go back to von Neumann's
scheme: look at two successive bits.  If they're equal, discard them.
Otherwise, map &lt;0,1&gt; to 0 and &lt;1,0&gt; to 1.

See the section on &quot;Software whitening&quot; in
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator</A> (which
was correct as of when I looked at it, a few minutes before the
timestamp on this email; check the Wiki history to be sure....).
