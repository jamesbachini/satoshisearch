</I>Ah, but this is a quantum system.  I think it's more a matter of
inducing correlations than a physical transfer.

Are trust, relevance, and purpose orthogonal variables?  That seems
unlikely.  So you need to trade of your ability to measure them.

Ah, there are some trustworthy photons.  Oops, we can trust them, but
we don't know if they are relevant.  Ah, there's a relevant photon....
