There is no readily apparent reason why N and g should not be 
application wide.

Of course, some clever persons might discover some unobvious flaw.

Rather than using SRP, you might use J-PAKE.  J-PAKE has a proof that 
there is nothing wrong with J-PAKE unless there is something wrong with 
all similar protocols, so you can go right ahead and do what all the 
other protocols do - which is one value of N and g for all.
