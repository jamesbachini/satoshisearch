<PRE>Can anyone tell me... is there a Firefox plugin which allows one to view the 
fingerprint of the SSL certificate of each page you visit (e.g. in the status 
bar or address bar or something)?

Better still if it can learn which ones you trust, but just being able to view 
them without having to jump through hoops would be a good start.
