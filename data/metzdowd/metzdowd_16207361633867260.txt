You're misunderstanding the threat model.  The problem here is that commercial
vendors are in a panic because the certification of free OSS security tools is
allowing all sorts of riff-raff onto the previously exclusive US government
purchasing gravy train.  In order to keep the gravy train free of said riff-
raff, they've kept up a steady stream of objections to the certification based
on various nitpicks.  While it's possible to say &quot;There's something we noticed
here in the source code that requires the software to be ejected from the
train&quot;, it's a bit harder to say &quot;We spent three months reverse-engineering
someone else's proprietary protected intellectual property and think we may
have found something&quot;.
