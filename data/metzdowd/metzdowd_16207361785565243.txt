Subject: [P1619-3] Last reminder: Call for Speakers and Sponsors for the 2008 Key Management Summit Ends This Friday

(Please forward this message as needed to other related groups) 

KMS 2008 has now filled-up all 8 vendor slots. However, we will still consider accepting additional sponsors if there is enough room on the agenda. Please send a message to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">sponsors at keymanagementsummit.com</A> if you would like to be added to the list of alternate sponsors. 

The sponsor agreement form is now available on the 'Sponsors' page. 

If you are interested in speaking at KMS 2008, please submit an abstract (and preferably a speaker bio) to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">chair at keymanagementsummit.com</A> by this Friday , May 30th . Slots are filling up fast! 

MSST has hotel and transportation information available as well. Hotel rooms are $219 per night, a significant discount from the usual $300+/night rates. 

Registration fees will be set in June and will likely be in the $300-$400 range for two days at KMS (food included), depending on final sponsorship contributions. 

Thanks!

Details: 


The IEEE Key Management Summit brings together the top companies that develop cryptographic key management for storage devices with the standards organizations that make interoperability possible. 

With recent legislation, such as California's SB 1386 or Sarbanes-Oxley, companies now have to publicly disclose when they lose unencrypted personal data. To meet this new need for encryption, many companies have developed solutions that encrypt data on hard disks and tape cartridges. The problem is that these data storage vendors need a solution for managing the cryptographic keys that protect the encrypted data. 

This summit aims to provide clarity to the key management by showing how existing products and standards organizations address the problem of interoperability and security. 

KMS 2008 is co-located with the IEEE Mass Storage and Systems Technologies conference in Baltimore, Maryland on September 23 -24, 2008. 

See <A HREF="http://www.keymanagementsummit.com/2008/">http://www.keymanagementsummit.com/2008/</A> for more details.
