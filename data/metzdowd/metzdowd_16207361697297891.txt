That's only a part of it.  Military silicon has a hardware RNG on chip
alongside a range of other things because they know full well that you can't
trust only a hardware/noise-based RNG, there are too many variables and too
many things that can go wrong with that single source.  That's why I was
sceptical of the &quot;we've solved the RNG problem with our custom hardware&quot;
claim, they've created one possible source of input but not a universal
solution.
