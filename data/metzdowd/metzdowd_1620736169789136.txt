<PRE>So at the company I work for, most of the internal systems have
expired SSL certs, or self-signed certs.  Obviously this is bad.

I know that if we had IT put our root cert in the browsers, that we
could then generate our own SSL certs.

Are there any options that don't involve adding a new root CA?

I would think this would be rather common, and I may have heard about
certs that had authority to sign other certs in some circumstances...
