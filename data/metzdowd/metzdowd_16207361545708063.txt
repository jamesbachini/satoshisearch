<PRE>I don't think fingerprint scanners work in a way that's obviously
amenable to hashing with &quot;well-known&quot; algorithms. Fingerprint scanners
produce an image, from which some features can be identified. But, not
all the same features can be extracted identically every time an image
is obtained.  I know there's been research into fuzzy hashing schemes,
but are they sufficiently secure, fast, and easy to code that they
would be workable for this?
