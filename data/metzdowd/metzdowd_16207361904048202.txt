This material is in fact tracked but not so publicly
reported.  You named the obvious sources, but no one
to my knowledge publishes regularly.

I previously committed myself to doing this annually,
and am about to convince myself to go quarterly.  See


    <A HREF="http://geer.tinho.net/ieee/ieee.geer.0801.pdf">http://geer.tinho.net/ieee/ieee.geer.0801.pdf</A>


for what I am (lightheartedly) talking about.
