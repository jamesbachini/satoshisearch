<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> For an unproxied site, I get a small green window with my own choice

Ja I have always wondered why the entire browser color scheme doesn't 
change ... granted users would just ignore it or complain it messes with 
their skins / schemes but still would be appreciated ... I myself hardly 
pay attention to the lock (its simply unobtrusive in a status bar full 
of other applets and addons) and I know better :)

/me wonders if their is a security UI list
