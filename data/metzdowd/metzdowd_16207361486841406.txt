I'd suggest starting from the deployment, training, and help desk
costs.  The technology is free, getting users to use it is not.  I
helped several banks look at this stuff in the late 90s, when cost of
a smartcard reader was order ~25, and deployment costs were estimated
at $100, and help desk at $50/user/year.
