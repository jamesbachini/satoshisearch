<PRE>I was asked off-list for a pointer to an explanation of DNSSEC. I guess 
there may be other readers who'd like that, so here's a pointer to 
Matasano Chargen's rather beautiful exposition:

<A HREF="http://www.matasano.com/log/case-against-dnssec/">http://www.matasano.com/log/case-against-dnssec/</A>

Unfinished, but good enough. In particular, part 2 explains DNSSEC

<A HREF="http://www.matasano.com/log/772/a-case-against-dnssec-count-2-too-complicated-to-deploy/">http://www.matasano.com/log/772/a-case-against-dnssec-count-2-too-complicated-to-deploy/</A>

Cheers,

Ben.
