Actually, I hear that some companies store the keys on the platters of
the disk. Again this is if they're actually using crypto and not just
selling XOR'ed blocks of data.

To project the keys, they limit standard read commands to not enter
those areas of the disk. Of course the vendor provides a method to read
those areas of disk, it's just a matter of finding them.
