Well, they are some tests to judge the &quot;quality&quot; of a random number
generator. The best known being the Diehard tests:

<A HREF="http://stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard/">http://stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard/</A>

For sure, these tests might be an overkill here. Also, there must be
some tests in the Art of Computer Programming too but I don't have it
at hand right now (shame on me).

I don't see the point of evaluating the quality of a random number
generator by statistical tests. But I might be wrong, though.
