That's not at all what I suggested. There are so many ways that one  
can creatively screw up reasonable cryptographic advice that I don't  
think it's worth bothering with.

The point is that if you take a cheap 640x480 (or 320x240) webcam and  
point it against a photographic grey card, there's going to be a lot  
of noise in it, and this noise is at its bottom quantum in nature.  
Thus, there's a lot of entropy in that noise. Photographic engineers  
work *hard* to remove that noise, and you pay for a lack of noise.

I'm willing to bet that if I give you hashes of frames, knowing this  
process, you can't get pre-images. I'll bet that you can't get pre- 
images even if I let you put a similar camera next to the one I'm  
using. In short, I'm willing to bet that a cheap camera is a decent  
random number source, even if you try to control the image source, to  
the tune of 128-256 bits of entropy per frame.

No lava lamps are needed, no weird hardware. Just use the noise in a  
CCD.
