Yes, but an FDE product built on the OSSL FIPS module would not likely
meet the FIPS 140-2 check box, as there is potentially more FIPS 140-2
relevant functionality in the FDE product beyond what was validated in
the OSSL module, such as, say, the whole key life cycle for the FDE
product. That does not necessarily mean all of the FDE product is FIPS
relevant, so perhaps the FIPS relevant functionality in the FDE product
could be self-contained and validated by itself, or perhaps the whole
FDE product could be validated and the irrelevant functionality just
excluded from the FIPS requirements, etc. (As Gutmann says though,
vendors sometimes successfully employ a bit of hand-waving here, so you
never quite know what will satisfy the FIPS check box.)

Yes, the details are important. The OSSL FIPS module was tested on those
platforms, but is vendor affirmed on other platforms, assuming the
module meets the vendor affirmation requirements described in the FIPS
140-2 implementation guidance on a given &quot;other&quot; platform.
