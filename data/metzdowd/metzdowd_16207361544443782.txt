<PRE>Back in the late 60's I was playing with audio and a magazine I subscribed
to had a circut for creating warble tones for standing wave and room
resonance testing.

The relevance of this is that they were using a &quot;random&quot; noise generating
chip that they acknowledged was not random enough for good measurements. The
fix suggested was to parallel a number, six as I recall, to improve the
randomness by mixing the signals to achieve better randomness. I don't
recall the math but the approach improved the randomness by more than an
order of magnitude. 

I have also seen the same effect on reverse biased zener diodes used as
random noise generators and that seemed - no real hard measurements that I
can recall - to work quite well. Mind you these were not zeners all
fabricated on a single chip, but rather individuals soldered together so the
charateristics of each were more random because of the semi-randomness of
the manufacturing process.

Perhaps a similar approach could be used here.

Best,

Allen

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like an interesting idea - using SRAM state as a source of 
</I>&gt;<i> randomness. Any of the folks here willing to comment on this?

</I>&gt;<i> Abstract.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> RFID applications create a need for low-cost security and
</I>&gt;<i> privacy in potentially hostile environments. Our measurements show
</I>&gt;<i> that initialization of SRAM produces a physical fingerprint. We propose
</I>&gt;<i> a system of Fingerprint Extraction and Random Numbers in SRAM
</I>&gt;<i> (FERNS) that harvests static identity and randomness from existing
</I>&gt;<i> volatileCMOSstorage.Theidentityresultsfrommanufacture-timephys-
</I>&gt;<i> icallyrandomdevicethresholdmismatch,andtherandomnumbersresult
</I>&gt;<i> from run-time physically random noise. We use experimental data from
</I>&gt;<i> virtual tags, microcontroller memory, and the WISP UHF RFID tag to
</I>&gt;<i> validate the principles behind FERNS. We show that a 256byte SRAM
</I>&gt;<i> can be used to identify circuits among a population of 160 virtual tags,
</I>&gt;<i> and can potentially produce 128bit random numbers capable of passing
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographic statistical tests.
