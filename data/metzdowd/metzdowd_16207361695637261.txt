An excellent observation Ian!!

I too have run into this mindset at enterprises with inhouse security teams 
(mostly in Silicon Valley).  They focus on the nuts and bolts like 
producing/using cryptographic libaries, fixing security bugs in code or 
configuring network appliances to stop intrusions.  But it is really hard 
to find any of them with decent experience or knowledge at the overall 
software/hardware/people system design level. They are often very smart and 
educated engineers. I find that there's this &quot;mindless&quot; focus on using 
groups of &quot;security&quot; standards, e.g PKI / LDAP / SSL type of combinations, 
etc.  The DoD contractor firms seem to be a little bit better at 
recognizing the system level aspects of security, although they too are 
often blinded by the emphasis on &quot;COTS&quot; security products.
