&quot;Proof of security&quot; is actively harmful, for the best
proofs of security are not worth much, and merely by
existing, they give license for people to produce proofs
that are amazingly worthless.   As &quot;proofs&quot; of ever
diminishing value multiply, it becomes difficult to
distinguish the multitude of utterly worthless &quot;proofs&quot;
from those proofs that have some limited value.

While it is possible to produce a proof that is actually
worth something, lots of morons glibly churn out large
numbers of proofs that are as stupid as they are
worthless.

Even the best &quot;proofs&quot; of security involve some
misdirection and a lowering of our standards about
proof, whereupon one thousand idiots gleefully point at
that subtle lowering of standards as justification to
lower standards a great deal further - snake oil wearing
the decorations of mathematics.
