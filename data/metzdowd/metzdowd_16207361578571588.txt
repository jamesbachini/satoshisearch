It would assist understanding, I feel, if we thought about 4 kilobits of
entropy, rather than a 4 kilobit value. I want to make this distinction
because I'd like to talk about secret keys, which have to be rather
larger than 4 kbits to have 4kbits of entropy for modular arithmetic stuff.

Given the above, it seems there's an obvious formulation.

Let's say the cost of a brute force attack on the secret itself is 2^xn
for n bits of entropy in the secret (it seems that this is actually the
interesting definition of entropy in this case, somewhat circularly).
Similarly, the cost of a brute force attack on the encryption protecting
the secret is 2^ym, where y is the entropy in the password.

So, when 2^ym &lt; 2^xn, it is worth attacking the password.

So, ym &lt; xn and hence m &lt; xn/y.

In other words, your password needs to be x/y times the size of the
secret (in bits), where x and y are the costs of attacking the secret
and the password respectively.
