The article is sensational nonsense. The quote is right on the money,
businesses require disk encryption companies to support one time unprotected
reboot (enabled securely before reboot) to support automated rebuilds.

Without this requirement, the Windows desktop support teams refuse to
field the products. The problem is not interesting, the feature cannot
be enabled after the fact.
