So what are the options these days (the article even mentions end-to-end
encryption to make such an attack far more difficult)?
Every &quot;crypto-phone&quot; offering seems to go stale and disappear after a
while...perhaps related to the fact of being ridiculously expensive.
Aren't run-of-the-mill cellphones these days powerful enough to use
available software like OpenSSL to encrypt voice/datastreams?
Again...what are the options for end-to-end cell encryption right now?
