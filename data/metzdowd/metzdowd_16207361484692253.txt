Not as I read the statute (and of course I'm not a lawyer).  Have a
look at 18 USC 2512
(<A HREF="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002512----000-.html">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00002512----000-.html</A>)

	any person who intentionally ...

	manufactures, assembles, possesses, or sells any electronic,
	mechanical, or other device, knowing or having reason to know
that the design of such device renders it primarily useful for the
	purpose of the surreptitious interception of wire, oral, or
	electronic communications, and that such device or any component
	thereof has been or will be sent through the mail or transported
	in interstate or foreign commerce;

	...

So simple possession of a surreptitious interception device is illegal,
with exceptions for things like sale to law enforcement or
communications companies.

Probably -- that's not surreptitious.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the most publicized cases of cellular interception,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including the two mentioned above, were interceptions of analog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calls.  Such interception was not too hard to do.  In some cases you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could pick up one side of such calls on old American TV sets (sets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that tuned above channel 69 on the UHF dial).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The technical requirement was for a TV with a UHF analog *tuner* as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to a digital channel-selection dial.  The channels that the
</I>&gt;<i> cellular network used (still uses?  I don't know) were inbetween the
</I>&gt;<i> channels that were assigned whole numbers in TV tuning.  So you could
</I>&gt;<i> pick up some cell traffic if you tuned, for example, to UHF TV
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;channel&quot; 78.44.  But not if you tuned to channel 78 or channel 79.
</I>
The specific law I had in mind when I posted that note was the
ban on scanners capable of picking up cellular bands, as well as
decoders to convert digital cellular signals to analog.  See
<A HREF="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3457/is_n17_v11/ai_13701996">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3457/is_n17_v11/ai_13701996</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/Legislation/?f=bills_affect_online.notice.txt">http://www.eff.org/Legislation/?f=bills_affect_online.notice.txt</A>

There are other provisions in the law that bar interception of
encrypted or scrambled signals, but I haven't waded through the
verbiage enough to know if they apply here.
