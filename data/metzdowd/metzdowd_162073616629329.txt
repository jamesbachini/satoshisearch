 &gt; &gt; Why not just require that the senders of malign
 &gt; &gt; packets set the Evil Bit in their IP headers?
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; How can you possibly require that encrypted traffic
 &gt; &gt; *generated by the attackers* will allow itself to be
 &gt; &gt; inspected?

 &gt; You misunderstand me.  We can for the most part easily

Steganography will beat that.  If the government demands
non random bits, non random bits will be provided.

 &gt; If it is a standard (or even a defacto standard like
 &gt; Skype) we can require access under proper authority.
 &gt; If it is not (or access under authority is refused),
 &gt; then just simply block or drop the packets, there's no
 &gt; need to inspect them.

This means that only authorized, regulated, officially
registered data formats shall be permitted.  It will be
almost impossible, most likely completely impossible,
for *my* format to get registered even though it sends
data completely in the clear.  Skype will be
grandfathered in, but the next Skype will not be.

So I will do what the bad guys do - steganograph my
entirely innocuous application, which would not need
cryptography at all except to escape intrusive
regulation, forcing me to hide my actual data format
inside a registered and officially authorized data
format.
