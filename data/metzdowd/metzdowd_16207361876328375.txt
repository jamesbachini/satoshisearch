If you have a locally service that uses them, sure. In any case, a
ticket gives you access to a crypto key, and you can use that for all
sorts of things.

Well, again, you can do the same thing with Kerberos, and Kerberos has
the added advantage that there is a complete spec that fully handles
all the details and is actually implemented and available off the
shelf -- even built in to Windows. SKMS is vaporware that leaves all
the hard parts of the specification out.

I'm inclined to dismiss it, if only because you can do all of it with
existing, implemented and fully specified tools with no added
complexity. I actually have much larger reservations, but I think that
alone eliminates the reason to consider it.

I think that comparing the advance SQL made with SKMS seems a bit
unreasonable.
