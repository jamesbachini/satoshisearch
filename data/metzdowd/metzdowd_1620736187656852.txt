Painting the camera lenses with laser pointers is quite effective, at least as
a short-term civil-disobedience measure.  Since there's no long-term damage
caused (unless you use a really impressive laser pointer) it's a bit tricky to
charge you with anything, at least under current law.

Or you could follow the lead of Captain Gatso in the UK...
