</I>&gt;<i> The original paper on this is:

But he probably wants an encryption scheme, not a cipher.

Also, correct me if I am wrong, but Black and Rogaway's approach is not 
efficient for large domains. But if you use their approach for small 
domains then you open yourself up to dictionary attacks.
