&gt;<i> Interesting tidbit:

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Nick Ogden, a Briton who launched one of the world's first e-commerce
</I>&gt;<i> processors in 1994, has developed a system for voice-signed financial
</I>&gt;<i> transactions. The Voice Transact platform was developed by Ogden's
</I>&gt;<i> Voice Commerce Group in partnership with U.S. speech software firm
</I>&gt;<i> Nuance Communications.&quot;
</I>
Looks a bit fishy because Nuance Communications hasn't issued a similar
press release about their cooperation.  There's also a total lack of
technical content.

And calling voice recordings &quot;biometrics&quot; is a bit of a stretch--you
could ask your customer about color preferences and label it
&quot;biometrics&quot;, too.
