<PRE>[Moderator's note: Please do not top post. --Perry]

I am thinking that trust is a relationship.  &quot;A trusts B&quot;.  So if you  
start with &quot;A trusts B&quot; and you do some operation that results in &quot;C  
trusts B&quot; then you have not copied anything because &quot;A trusts B&quot; is  
not equal to &quot;C trusts B&quot;.  You can't call that operation a &quot;copy&quot;.   
I can't think of any scenario where it even makes sense to talk about  
copying trust.  The closest thing I can think of would be a document,  
or record in a database, or a certificate, or similar thing that  
reminds me that &quot;I trust X&quot;.  That is consistent with Bill Frantz's  
comment on memory.  (hi Bill)  I can copy the reminder, but that  
doesn't copy the trust.  The trust exists, it seems to me, with or  
without the reminder (even if I have temporarily forgotten about it).

Kind regards,

-Bill
