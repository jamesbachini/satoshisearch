   WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Five years ago, Congress killed an experimental
   Pentagon antiterrorism program meant to vacuum up electronic data
   about people in the U.S. to search for suspicious patterns. Opponents
   called it too broad an intrusion on Americans' privacy, even after the
   Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

   But the data-sifting effort didn't disappear. The National Security
   Agency, once confined to foreign surveillance, has been building
   essentially the same system.
