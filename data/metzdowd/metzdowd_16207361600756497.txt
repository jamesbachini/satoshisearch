<PRE>I'm looking for a halfway self-contained set of ITU-T recommendations
which are relevant for implementing X.509v3 certificates.  The
references in RFC 3280 appear to be incomplete; for instance, a
reference for ASN.1 itself is missing.

Or is it unreasonable to expect that the specs match what is actually
needed for interoperability with existing implementations (mostly in the
TLS, S/MIME area)?
