If the user is used to logging in by a user interface that is not easy 
for forge remotely - click on bookmark to bring up a user interface that 
is difficult to remotely forge - then this does indeed work.

There is always the give-your-password-over-the-phone attack, but the 
fact that phishers seeking WoW gold actually have to use the 
give-your-password-over-the-phone attack against WoW players shows the 
potency of a deliberately non standard, difficult to forge, user interface.

WoW security does not stop phishing, but it makes phishers work for 
their money. WoW keeps telling users &quot;never give your password to 
another person, no one at WoW will ever ask you for your password&quot;. 
Obvious advice, easy to understand and follow.
