<PRE>If a proof is a record of a mental journey in which one person has 
discovered an important truth, and then made a record of that journey 
adequate so that a second person can walk the same path and see the same 
truth, then cryptography could do with more and better proofs.

If, on the other hand, a proof is an argument impressively decorated 
with mathematical sounding jargon, cryptography could do with a good 
deal fewer of them.
