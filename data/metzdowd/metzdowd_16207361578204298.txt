<PRE>|<i> Xerox Unveils Technology That Blocks Access to Sensitive Data in
</I>|<i> Documents to Prevent Security Leaks

</I>|<i> The Innovation: The technology includes a detection software tool that
</I>|<i> uses content analysis and an intelligent user interface to easily
</I>|<i> protect sensitive information. It can encrypt only the sensitive
</I>|<i> sections or paragraphs of a document, a capability previously not
</I>|<i> available.
</I>Actually, it looks as if Xerox has been doing a bunch of very
interesting work on the borderlines of security, privacy,
cryptography, and human factors.  I hadn't noticed it before.

Look, for example, at:

(Now, can anyone account for the bizarre very light gray pattern
of lines that appear behind the top half or so of this page?)
