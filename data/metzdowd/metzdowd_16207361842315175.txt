<PRE>Quoting the Foxbusiness article:

&quot;PermanentPrivacy announces the world's first practical data
encryption system that is absolutely unbreakable. And is offering a
$1,000,000 challenge to anyone who can crack it.

Permanent Privacy (patent pending) has been verified by Peter
Schweitzer, one of Harvard's top cryptanalysts, and for the inevitable
cynics Permanent Privacy is offering $1,000,000 to anyone who can
decipher a sample of ciphertext.&quot;
