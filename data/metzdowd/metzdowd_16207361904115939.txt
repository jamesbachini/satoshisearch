 | &gt; essentially too cheap to meter, you often have to buy the stuff in

I have had a guy who wished to remain nameless
claim that he makes a fine living breaking into
the machines of black-market card sellers and
copying the card numbers they have for sale.
He then (he says) takes those card numbers to
the issuing banks and sells those numbers to the
banks so that the banks can prophylactically
cancel the soon-to-be-affected cards.  He claimed
to get 50c/card.  All hearsay...
