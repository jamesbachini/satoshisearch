Selected quote:

   To avoid wiretapping every communication, NSA will need to build
   massive automatic surveillance capabilities into telephone
   switches. Here things get tricky: Once such infrastructure is in
   place, others could use it to intercept communications.

   Grant the NSA what it wants, and within 10 years the United States
   will be vulnerable to attacks from hackers across the globe, as
   well as the militaries of China, Russia and other nations.
