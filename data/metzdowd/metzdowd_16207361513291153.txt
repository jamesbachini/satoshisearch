<PRE>That's a pretty in-credible report.

Emphasis on &quot;in-&quot;.

It's disturbing to see &quot;Security Researchers&quot; so willing to trade on

The conclusion is pretty confusing.

&gt;<i>  Conclusion
</I>&gt;<i> Internet-based attacks are extremely popular with terrorist  
</I>&gt;<i> organizations because they are relatively cheap to perform, offer a  
</I>&gt;<i> high degree of anonymity, and can be tremendously effective.

Perhaps author Jeffrey Carr should stick to coverage of 'semantic and  
geospatial intelligence applications'.

I'd sure like credible details...
