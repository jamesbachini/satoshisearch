<PRE>&gt;<i>From a fun article on the history of computing
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.neatorama.com/2008/01/25/the-wonderful-world-of-early-computing">http://www.neatorama.com/2008/01/25/the-wonderful-world-of-early-computing</A>&gt;

    The 20,000-year-old bone revealed that early civilization had
    mastered arithmetic series and even the concept of prime
    numbers.

This predates the Egyptian and Greek references to prime number
knowledge I have heard about by a wide margin. Unfortunately, the
article doesn't go into any more detail then the quote above.
