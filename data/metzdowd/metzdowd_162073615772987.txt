I disagree.  I was referring to the *standard* case (no point
compression, no special performance tweaks).  If you're building
something high performance, choosing special curves, etc., you're in a
different playing field.  Whether it's possible to do an efficient
implementation in hw without resorting to those techniques is a very
specific question that I won't answer here.

I won't go into any more detail since it's not a good policy to publicly
discuss patents.  I just wanted to respond to the FUD that the original
poster was spreading re: EC being covered by patents that had expired.
