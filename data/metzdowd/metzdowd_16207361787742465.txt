OpenBSD has recently added the ipsecctl command, which greatly simplifies 
setting up IPSEC VPNs, especially between OpenBSD machines. A config file can 
be as simple as (from the man page):

ike esp from 192.168.3.1 to 192.168.3.2
ike esp from 10.1.1.0/24 to 10.1.2.0/24 peer 192.168.3.2

And the file structure for storing certs, public/private keys, and shared 
secrets (which ipsecctl searches automatically) is equally simple.
