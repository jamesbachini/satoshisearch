It seems the the answer would be yes for the laptop at the very least.

&gt;<i> What's that - I have to use some opaque mechanism to key my drive? Pass.

It appears to use a firmware implementation. To quote their pdf I linked
to before [0]:
&quot;DriveTrust technology implements on the drive a cryptographic service
provider that provides encryption, hashing, secure storage, decryption,
digital signature and random-number generating functions&quot;

Though I think that unless they're providing their full firmware code,
it's not to be trusted. Though it should be possible to examine the on
disk bits with other known good implementations of AES128 (CBC? I'm not
sure...).

&gt;<i> And how do I know that the drive didn't just store a copy of my

</I>&gt;<i> some magic sequence of negative sectors? And what about a zillion

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
All the more reason to investigate it. I wonder if they'll provide their
firmware if a big enough client were to request it. They also claim to
be about open standards:
&quot;An open standard is being developed within the Trusted Computing Group.&quot;

Perhaps one of the Seagate developers is on this list? If not, I think
they probably should be...
