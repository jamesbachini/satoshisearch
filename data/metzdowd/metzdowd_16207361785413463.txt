<PRE>So, what is it on the device that is using the 3DES key to encrypt
chunks to send to the RIM messaging gateway?  Something on the 
device has to encrypt/decrypt the data sent to/from the messaging
server?  Doesn't that constitute a session even if the 3DES keys
are rotated frequently?  (And, if they are, how are the 3DES keys
agreed upon?  Doesn't that imply public/private key-pairs or a
master-key?)

The keys are symmetric 3DES, and encrypt message chunks (IIRC either
256 or 1K bytes) sent asynchronously to the enterprise messaging gateway.
RIM does not have a secure session with the device. This is not like
S/MIME except that as with S/MIME, this is not hop-by-hop encryption.
