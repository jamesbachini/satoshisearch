I'm working on the third edition of _Disappearing Cryptography_ right  
now. If anyone knows of any technical errors in the second edition,  
I'm willing to pay $20 for the first person to report each technical  
error.

The bounty can't apply to grammatical errors because of the  
complexity of the language. I reserve the right to (1) decide on  
whether something is a legitimate technical error and (2) give out  
more than one award if several people send in the same bug report and  
seem to be genuinely independent. The limit is just meant to stop  
people from minting money.

Thanks,


-Peter Wayner
