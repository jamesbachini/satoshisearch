<PRE>Even if RIM does not have the device keys, in order to share encrypted
data with applications on the RIM server, the device must share a session 
key with the server; must it not?.  Isn't RIM (their software, actually) 
now in a position to decrypt content sent between Blackberry users?  Or, 
does the Blackberry encryption protocol work like S/MIME?

Wow, and April 1st was almost two months ago.  This is just a bunch
of FUD.  If someone actually talked to RIM they would find out that
it's technically impossible for them to do this because THEY DONT HAVE
THE DEVICE KEYS.
