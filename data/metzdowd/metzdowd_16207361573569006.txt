Assumption: clearing the password stores the key encrypted with
password &quot;&quot; or an all-zeros key, or some other similar construct,
effectively in plain text.

Speculation: the drive always encrypts the platters with a (fixed) AES
key, obviating the need to track which sectors are encrypted or
not. Setting the drive password simply changes the key-handling.

Implication: fixed keys may be known and data recoverable from factory
records, e.g. for law enforcement, even if this is not provided as an
end-user service.
