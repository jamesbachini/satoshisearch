It's a real (old) vulnerability in DH, but I don't think it applies
here. If you want to expose the cleartext of your IPsec traffic, you
can just send a copy to the observer.

It makes mitm easier on unauthenticated links, but that's not a new
exposure of any kind.

    There are a number of real-world scenarios where an unknown
key-share completely undermines the legitimacy of networking
infrastructure which is designed to provide high security.

Funny how they didn't provide any details.
