Who hasn't?  Oh, I'm sorry -- I meant to say: who, outside of the
set of producers and consumers of security snake oil aimed at
financial institutions, hasn't?

Regular readers will recall the SecurID discussion of about a
year ago, when an individual who appeared to be a paid consultant
to RSA vigorously put forth the notion that secure devices which
required the user to actually do something to authenticate a
transaction were _not_ what was needed -- to the shock and awe
of most readers of, and writers to, the thread here, at least
as I would summarize the discussion.
