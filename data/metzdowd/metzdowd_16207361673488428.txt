<PRE>With this discussion of virtualization and security, it might be a  
good time to note:


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IEEE Security &amp; Privacy
</I>&gt;<i> Special issue on virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> September/October 2008
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deadline for submissions: 6 February 2008
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Visit www.computer.org/portal/pages/security/author.xml to submit a  
</I>&gt;<i> manuscript
</I>&gt;<i> Guest editors: Samuel T. King (UIUC), Sean W. Smith (Dartmouth)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Virtualization has several properties that make it useful for  
</I>&gt;<i> security applications. Traditional virtual machine monitors aspire  
</I>&gt;<i> to enforce strong isolation among multiple operating systems (OSes)  
</I>&gt;<i> running on the same physical hardware, enable software services to  
</I>&gt;<i> be implemented below the OS at a layer usually only accessible by  
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, and provide low-level software with convenient  
</I>&gt;<i> abstractions of the virtual machine&#237;s hardware resources. Other  
</I>&gt;<i> approaches aspire to provide multiple virtual but isolated images  
</I>&gt;<i> of the same OS installation. These properties helped foster a new  
</I>&gt;<i> class of virtual-machine- based security services and made  
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization a staple of many enterprise computing environments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A common topic in the early days of computing, virtualization has  
</I>&gt;<i> recently seen a resurgence of commercial and research interest.  
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently, the security implications of virtualization  
</I>&gt;<i> technology are the topic of the Sept./Oct. 2008 special issue of  
</I>&gt;<i> IEEE Security &amp; Privacy magazine. We are looking for feature  
</I>&gt;<i> articles with an in-depth coverage of topics related to  
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization technology and how it applies to security. Among the  
</I>&gt;<i> potential topics are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Virtualization for intrusion detection
</I>&gt;<i> --Virtualization for forensic analysis of compromised computer systems
</I>&gt;<i> --Virtualization for analyzing malicious software
</I>&gt;<i> --Hardware support for secure virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> --Security interfaces between VMMs and operating systems
</I>&gt;<i> --Securing applications using virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> --Securing attacks using virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> --Security analysis of virtualization
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above list is neither complete nor closed. Authors are  
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged to submit articles that explore other aspects of  
</I>&gt;<i> virtualization and its application to security. Submissions will be  
</I>&gt;<i> subject to the peer-review methodology for refereed papers.  
</I>&gt;<i> Articles should be understandable to a broad audience of people  
</I>&gt;<i> interested in security and privacy. The writing should be down to  
</I>&gt;<i> earth, practical, and original. Authors should not assume that the  
</I>&gt;<i> audience will have specialized experience in a particular subfield.  
</I>&gt;<i> All accepted articles will be edited according to the IEEE Computer  
</I>&gt;<i> Society style guide.
