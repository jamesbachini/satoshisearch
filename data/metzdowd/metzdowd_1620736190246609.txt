I would suggest that, in the &quot;real world&quot;, most of the people that
are nearly impossible to protect, don't have much money. Now &quot;real
world&quot; scams have been around for quite a while, and we teach about
them in school. However they still work with some people, which is
why those people don't have much money.

Online scams are newer, and many of their victims left school long
before the scams became popular. I expect the online situation will
stabilize in about the same way as the &quot;real world&quot; one has.
