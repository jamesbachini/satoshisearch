Perhaps you'd like to expand upon this a bit. I am a bit confused by 
your assertion. tcp/587 is the standard authenticated submission port, 
while tcp/465 is the normal smtp/ssl port - of course one could run any 
mix of one or the other on either port. Are you suggesting that some 
postmasters/admins are claiming that their Submission ports are encrypted?
