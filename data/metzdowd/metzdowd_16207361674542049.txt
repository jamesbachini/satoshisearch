<PRE>&gt;<i> How much security can you put into a plastic card, the size of a
</I>&gt;<i> credit card, that has to perform its function in a secure manner, all
</I>&gt;<i> in under 2 seconds (in under 1 second in parts of Asia)? And it has to
</I>&gt;<i> do this while receiving its power via the electromagnetic field being
</I>&gt;<i> generated by the reader.

The 24C3 presenters to their credit made this exact point. But mixing the
16-bit nonce with the card identifier was an optimization too far.  That
said, it's a hard problem.  Inside Picopass is one of many examples that
progress is possible.

IMHO as always.
