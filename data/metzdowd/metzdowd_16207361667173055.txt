</I>|<i> Gee, the inventor is Simson Garfinkel, who's written a bunch of books
</I>|<i> including Database Nation, published in 2000 by O'Reilly, about all
</I>|<i> the way the public and private actors are spying on us.

</I>|<i> I wonder whether this was research to see how hard it was to
</I>|<i> get the PTO to grant an absurd patent.
</I>Alternatively, it could be an attempt to preempt any other patents
in this area.  We'll have to see what Garfinkle does with the
patent.

BTW, I don't see this as an example of an absurd patent.  There might
well be prior art, but the idea of erasing information by deliberately
discarding a key is certainly not completely obvious except in
retrospect.  If you look at any traditional crypto text, you won't
find anything of this sort - it wasn't the kind of thing people had
worried about until fairly recently.
