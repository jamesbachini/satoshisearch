So that should read about 182 cycles per block, and 18 cycles per round.
I though the number seems strange :-(.  I tent to always quote numbers
from a 2-3 second run encrypting a 4k buffer, not a machine cycle
counter over one or two blocks, so I leave myself open to this kind of
error :-(

Still, looking further at the various SSE5 instructions, I'm having
difficultly seeing how
to avoid instruction dependencies when using the SIMD instructions
(specifically using PPERM to implement the sbox).
