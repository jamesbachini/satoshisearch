The &quot;signature&quot; in the microcode update has not the same
meaning as within crypto. For intel chips it has 31bits and basically
contains a revision number. The requirements for the BIOS for
checking microcode updates are in short: check the crc and ensure
that older revisions cant replace new ones by comparing the &quot;signature&quot;.
I did not try myself, but I think one can probably update anything
if you just hexedit the update header.
Afaik these chips do not own any crypto-related functionallity
or storage capability (except precise timing and rand maybe) and
they are not tamper-proof. Thats why TPM was invented :-)
