Do you have any references?  Several people have brought this up before
and have been told that the design with depleting the entropy pool is
intentional.

Still, the semantics of /dev/*random is not standardized anywhere, and
the current implementation is sub-optimal from a practical point of
view, so I think we are far away from an even OK situation.
