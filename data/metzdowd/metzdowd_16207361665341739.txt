I don't think this is really being said. In fact, I've been pretty  
concretely saying &quot;here's an OS not designed from scratch, but with  
certain pieces modified, that's likely to be extremely resistant to  
viruses, malware and other pests&quot;, in regard to the OS being designed  
for the OLPC. We're still implementing large chunks of the security  
system, but my spec[0] has been public for a year, our security  
working group contains a number of people from this list, and no one  
so far has claimed that this design won't successfully resist most --  
though not all -- classes of attacks we've seen or can presently  
imagine seeing in the desktop security realm.
