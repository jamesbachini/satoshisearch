I don't think I agree with the &quot;DRM for batteries&quot; characterization. 
It's not my data in that battery that they're preventing me from 
getting at.

Given that illicit replica batteries can have particularly mediagenic 
failure modes, I posit that manufacturers are increasingly motivated 
to make sure that if the battery says NameBrand on it, it actually is 
a NameBrand battery. Counterfeit failures lead to brand damage and 
other unpleasant economic side-effects.

Not that real NameBrand batteries don't ever behave badly, but this 
type of countermeasure should also provide legitimate manufacturers 
with additional incentive not to screw up. Which is actually to the 
end users' benefit.
