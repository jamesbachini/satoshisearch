<PRE>What I don't understand is why you think tinc is necessary,
or even worth the trouble.

IPsec is readily available -- built into Windows, Mac OS
and various routers, and with implementations for Linux
and all the *BSDs -- has had quite a bit of expert
security analysis, and handles VPNs just fine.

Does tinc do something that IPsec cannot?
