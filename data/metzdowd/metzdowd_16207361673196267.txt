<PRE>Dear people of cryptography:

This is the latest release of a secure, decentralized filesystem.  It  
marries strong cryptography with the capability access control model  
to provide secure and flexible access control in a decentralized  
graph of files and directories.

While we think we've done a good job of designing and implementing  
this securely, we know that this kind of thing can have subtle  
problems, and we would welcome peer review of what we've done, as  
well as ideas of what we should do.

Regards,

Zooko O'Whielacronx

ANNOUNCING: Allmydata-Tahoe version 0.7

We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.7 of allmydata.org
&quot;Tahoe&quot;.

Tahoe is a secure, decentralized, fault-tolerant filesystem.  All of
the source code is available under a Free Software, Open Source
licence (or two).

This filesystem is encrypted and distributed over multiple peers in
such a way that it continues to work correctlly even when some of the
peers are unavailable, malfunctioning, or malicious.

This is the successor to Allmydata-Tahoe v0.6.1, which was released
October 15, 2007 [1].

This release adds decentralized, encrypted directories and mutable
files, making it the first release of Tahoe in which no part of the
filesystem is centralized.  It also adds a FUSE interface, allowing
you to access a distributed Tahoe grid as if it were a normal local
filesystem.

This is also the first release to be offered under a novel open source
licence which allows people to redistributed proprietary derivatives
of Tahoe for a limited time.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe, you can distribute your filesystem across a set of
computers, such that if some of the computers fail or turn out to be
malicious, the filesystem continues to work from the remaining
computers.  You can also share your files with other users, using a
strongly encrypted, capability-based access control scheme.

This release is targeted at hackers and smart users who are willing to
use a web user interface, a command-line user interface, or a FUSE
interface.  (Or a RESTful API.  Just telnet to localhost and type HTTP
requests to get started.)

Because this software is new, it is not yet recommended for storage of
highly confidential data nor for valuable data which is not otherwise
backed up. However, it works well in practice, it comes with extensive
unit tests, and there are no known security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity.  (For a current
description of all known security issues and an overview of Tahoe's
security properties, please see the Security web page: [2].)

This release of Tahoe is suitable for the &quot;friendnet&quot; use case [3] --
it is easy to create a filesystem spread over the computers of you
and your friends so that you can share files and disk space with one
another.


LICENCE

You may use this package under the GNU General Public License, version
2 or, at your option, any later version.  See the file &quot;COPYING.GPL&quot;
for the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 2.

You may use this package under the Transitive Grace Period Public
Licence, version 1.0.  The Transitive Grace Period Public Licence says
that you may distribute proprietary derived works of Tahoe without
releasing the source code of that derived work for up to twelve
months, after which time you are obligated to release the source code
of the derived work under the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence.
See the file &quot;COPYING.TGPPL.html&quot; for the terms of the Transitive
Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.0.

(You may choose to use this package under the terms of either licence,

INSTALLATION

Tahoe works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, and Solaris.  For
installation instructions please see &quot;doc/install.html&quot; [4].


HACKING AND COMMUNITY

Please join us on the mailing list [5] to discuss uses of Tahoe.
Patches that extend and improve Tahoe are gratefully accepted --
roadmap.txt [6] shows the next improvements that we plan to make and
CREDITS [7] lists the names of people who've contributed to the
project.  The wiki Dev page [8] contains resources for hackers.


SPONSORSHIP

Tahoe is sponsored by Allmydata, Inc. [9], a provider of consumer
backup services.  Allmydata, Inc. contributes hardware, software,
ideas, bug reports, suggestions, demands, and money (employing several
allmydata.org Tahoe hackers and allowing them to spend part of their
work time on the next-generation, free-software project).  We are
eternally grateful!
