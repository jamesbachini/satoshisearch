I've just looked at the virus. Upon invocation, it generates a random  
128-bit RC4 key with CryptGenKey, then for each file it generates a  
random IV with a very weak generator only capable of producing 256  
different 128-bit values for 99.9% of the files, prepends each file  
with its IV, then it encrypts that IV with the main RC4 key, hashes  
that with MD5 and that hash becomes the 128-bit RC4 encryption key  
for each file. It encrypts all the potentially valuable files like  
that while deleting the originals, then it encrypts the main RC4 key  
with one of its two hard-coded 1024-bit RSA public keys and saves it  
with one of the 4 e-mail addresses it comes with to contact the  
asshole who did this to you:

Not much can be done at this point as the executable terminates  
itself creating a script that deletes it and congratulates the user.  
It's not very different from the 90's hard drive formatting viruses  
except for the bold extortion that comes with it. A regular backup is  
your best friend.

The only thing that could probably be done by the most desperate  
would be to find the largest files with known plaintext and for all  
the encrypted files with the same first 16 bytes (roughly 1/256 of  
them), the keystream will match. No cryptography to implement, only  
XOR. Good luck!
