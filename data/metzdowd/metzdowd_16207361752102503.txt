<PRE>If your original mode of operation is secure, then this should be  
secure.

The reduction:

Consider algorithm A that tries to break the double encryption mode of  
operation (DM) in the IND-CPA setting.  We can construct an algorithm  
B that tries to break the original mode of operation (OM) in the IND- 
CPA setting.  B simply runs A and responds to A's queries by querying  
B's oracle twice to simulate A's oracle, and returning the result.  B  
returns the output of A.

If A breaks the encryption, so does B.  So if the original mode is IND- 
CPA secure, this double encryption should be okay.

Note that the examples given, OCB and CTR with repeated counters, are  
not IND-CPA secure.
