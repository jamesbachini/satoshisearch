One of my favourite papers, by Steve Bellovin, is at 
<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/bellovin.html">http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/bellovin.html</A>

It shows a number of ways in which IPsec with encryption but no 
integrity can fail.

Abstract:
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is in the process of adopting 
standards for IP-layer encryption and authentication (IPSEC). We 
describe a number of attacks against various versions of these 
protocols, including confidentiality failures and authentication 
failures. The implications of these attacks are troubling for the 
utility of this entire effort.
