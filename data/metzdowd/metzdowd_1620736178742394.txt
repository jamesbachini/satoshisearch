Apparently some pranksters hijacked Comcast's DNS entries for a few
hours:

[Hat tip to Bill Squier for pointing the article out.]

This is hardly the first time such a thing has happened. No great harm
was done, but considerable harm could have been done.

For example, one wonders what would happen if bank like Chase that
foolishly trains their users to type passwords into non-https
protected pages had their DNS hijacked for a while. (Indeed, given the
fact that most users always ignore certificate warnings, even a pretty
good bank that consistently used https would have serious trouble.)
