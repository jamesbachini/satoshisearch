Usability disasters such as DNSSEC are more common than strictly 
cryptographic disasters such as wifi.  DNSSEC is near impossible to use 
correctly end to end.

Usually a cryptographic system is very difficult to use correctly, or to 
use incorrectly - as for example various VPN products.

Sometimes a cryptographic system is easy to use incorrectly, difficult 
to use correctly, for example https and pretty much everything built on 
top of tls-ssl (old flame, never resolved, as to whether this is an 
inherent design flaw in the very concept of a cryptographic layer and 
any product that uses layering to factorize out the cryptographic code)
