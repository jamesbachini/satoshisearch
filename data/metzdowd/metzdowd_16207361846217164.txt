<PRE>I think Dan Kaminsky is on this list. Any other tidbits you can add 
prior to Black Hat?

Kaminsky Breaks DNS

Author: Dave Lewis

Well, sort of.

Today Dan Kaminsky released a first, as far as I can recall. A 
coordinated patch was released today by Dan Kaminsky of IO Active that 
fixes a vulnerability that apparently exists in all DNS servers.

Unlike other researchers who give up the gory details, Kaminsky took a 
wiser path by smiling and nodding. He&#8217;ll give up the goods at Black Hat 
in August. That should give folks enough time to patch their systems.
