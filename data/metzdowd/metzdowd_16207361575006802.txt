Amazingly, Tizor Systems does PCI reviews (actually they entirely seem
to do C&amp;A work), and I'm sure Prat would prefer to see the PCI gravy
train stay around. (I don't know the current state of the industry,
but when I was working in a consulting group 2004-2005, PCI reviews
were our most profitable engagement type by a large margin - and
non-technical enough that you can put a person with a few months of
security training on them and they'll do fine).
