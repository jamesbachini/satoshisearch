I think one of the problems with Bitlocker is that it is only
available in Vista Business Edition purchased  under MS Software
Assurance (SA). Not many shops have the MS SA. It is also available in
Ultimate but that is way tooo expensive. Also what about non-MS
operating systems?

The other problem is that it lacks any centralized management. If you
are letting TPM manage your Bitlocker keys you still need a TPM
management suite with key backup/restore/transfer/migrate capabilities
in case your computer goes bad.

The third problem is that it is software based encryption, which uses
the main CPU to perform the encryption.
