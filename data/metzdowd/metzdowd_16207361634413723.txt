Parlor trick.

More interesting.  Where on your web site?  I've long abhorred the
X.509 format, and was a supporter of a more clean alternative.

So far, all the things you mention require the certifier to be suborned.

Certainly it was done before!  We talked about it more than a decade ago.
We knew that what was &quot;computationally infeasible&quot; would become feasible.

Every protocol I've designed or formally reviewed is protected against the
chosen prefix attack.  (To qualify, where I had final say.  I've reviewed
badly designed protocols, such as IKE/ISAKMP.  And I've been overruled by
committee from time to time....)

What *would* be crypto is the quantification of where MDx currently falls
on the computational spectrum.
