<PRE>I'm not affiliated with Elcomsoft and don't know their real
intentions, but what they are trying to do is perfectly reasonable.
Once they release a commercial product with such feature it is only a
matter of time until Microsoft or some other patent troll will run for
a patent and start suing. So, having the patent beforehand will
address this matter. It still would be beneficial even if Elcomsoft
will fail this patent application, because it will make any future
such applications disputable.
