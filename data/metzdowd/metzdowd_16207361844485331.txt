I skipped over this part when reading the original message. Expecting per
Florian's original message the outputs to be a &quot;linear&quot; function of the
inputs, but they are not.

This of course applies to the 32-bit output of the RNG. The operation
of reducing the 32-bit output modulo 28333, is not &quot;linear&quot; (over the
F_2 bit string vector-space). While:

	x_96 = c_95 * x_95 + ... c_0 * x_0

this is only true bitwise modulo 2. It is not obvious how one might
recover the full 32-bit outputs from the truncated outputs.
