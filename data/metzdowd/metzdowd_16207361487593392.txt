There is a big difference between a TPM providing this kind of service, 
and Peter's device. The TPM is supposed to be hard-wired into a PC -- so 
if you are using it to safe your banking applications, you can do banking 
at one single PC. On the other hand, Peter's device is portable, you can 
use it to do safe banking from your PC at home, or in the office (only 
during lunch-breaks with the employer's permission of course), or even at 
a public internet cafe. To this end, Peter's device would be much more 
useful for the customer than a TPM ever could be.

BTW, Peter, are you aware that your device looks similar to the one 
proposed in the context of the CAFE project? See

This has been a more ambitious project, not just supporting secure banking 
applications at an insecure host PC, but rather a digital wallet.

Nevertheless, it may be interesting to study why the project failed (or 
ended without follow-on projects). I have no quick answer to this 
question, but as much as I understand, the banks where just not interested 
in deploying such a device. I guess, it was much too expensive at that 
time. Instead, in Germany we got the &quot;Geldkarte&quot;, a simple and very cheap 
smartcard for payment purposes with neither a display nor a keyboard. The 
&quot;Geldkarte&quot; has been around us for about ten years, and, as far as I can 
tell, hardly any customer is interested in using it.

So long
