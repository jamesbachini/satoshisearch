And yes, they always generate the stamp or imprint they sign.
To do otherwise would be irresponsible (and illegal).

There's this silly idea that's been floating around that a
digital signature is somehow equivalent to a human signature.
Or worse, somehow better?!?!  Heck, current U.S. law counts a
digitized sound as a signature!?!?

(Folks have lost money on this snake oil.  They deserved it.)

Anyway, this is irrelevant to the original topic.  That is:

   This implies a vulnerability in software integrity protection
   and code signing schemes that still use MD5.

Please quantify your spurious allegations (and stay on topic).
