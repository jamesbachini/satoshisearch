So this seems to me to only be really true in a theoretical sense. 
Exploring the whole 32 bit space obviously requires well in excess of 4 
GB of traffic, which is clearly a non-trivial amount to dump on your victim.

According to other data, the fix in BIND is to:

a) use random ports

b) use a good PRNG

so I'm beginning to suspect the issue is simply that the theory that it 
was easy to attack led to no effort being made to make it as hard as 
possible. And now it has.

The beauty of DNSSEC being, of course, that any answer that verifies can 
be trusted - so its of no interest who provided that answer.
