<PRE>Responding to Marcos el Ruptor's  allegation that the SecurID was 
&quot;snake oil,&quot; Paul Walker queried him and the Listocracy:

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;I didn't realise the current SecurID tokens had been broken. A 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quick Google
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;doesn't show anything, but I'm probably using the wrong terms. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;references for this that I could have a look at?
</I>
Vin McLellan (me) responded:

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'd also be interested in any evidence that the SecurID has been cracked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Any credible report would have the immediate attention of tens of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; thousands of RSA installations. Not to speak of EMC/RSA. itself, for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; which I have been a consultant for many years.
</I>
Thor Lancelot quoted that, and erupted with sanctimonious umbrage:

&gt;&gt;<i>That's right, you have.  As I recall, the last time you posted here was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when you tried to defend RSA's decision to sell no-human-interaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>tokens.  At that time, I asked you whether you were posting for yourself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>or whether someone at RSA had asked you to post here, and you declined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to respond.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I think it's important that we know, when flaws in commercial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>cryptographic products are being discussed, what the interests of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>parties to the discussion are.  So, I'll ask again, as I did last time:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>when you post here, both in this instance and in past instances, is it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>at your own behest, or that of RSA?
</I>
This is puerile.  One moderator is not enough? Now you want to set 
yourself up as the Inquisition to vet for ideological purity?  No one 
at RSA (or EMC, now RSA's parent firm) even knows about this 
discussion, you ninny. Who would care?

In three decades online, I have never posted a message in which I did 
not clearly indicate if a company or organization -- the subject of 
the discussion, or a firm with an interest in the topic -- was a 
commercial client of mine. (Not everyone, even in this forum, has 
been so fastidious.)

I've been an independent consultant on public policy and market 
development to RSA, off and on, for nearly 20 years. I'm really proud 
of my minor role in the Crypto Wars.  Over that time, I've certainly 
also made my bones as an informal evangelist for RSA products, 
services, and policies as well.

When I can, I try to offer explanations about RSA products when 
questions about them pop up in the Net's public forums.  (I've done 
the same for various other vendors, some clients, when I knew 
enough.)  I know a bit about industry history -- I even did a stint 
as IBM's historian -- so I occasionally offer my version when I feel 
the revisionists have things tied up in absurdist knots. If I offer 
an opinion, it's my own.  If I describe what RSA has done, it is an 
accurate report, AFAIK.

I know basically what any major RSA corporate customer knows. EMC 
issues its own policy statements and press releases. I don't speak 
for RSA or EMC, and no one there edits what I write.  Corporations, 
however, don't communicate well on the Net. I have the freedom to 
make casual comments, debate, where corporate committees do not. 
Sometimes, due to NDA constraints, I can't speak up -- but I never 
fly under false flags, nor do I lie.

I expect that any message in which I acknowledge a consulting link 
with a vendor will be taken with a proverbial grain of salt -- but 
typically, professionals will also accept claims of fact as 
provisionally valid, and will listen to arguments if they are 
sensibly made. You reap what you sow. It usually works out, but not 
always. Sometimes I screw up.  Sometimes I run into zealots who 
believe only certain voices should be heard.

I suspect that few objective readers will take my claims of fact 
about the SecurID, compare them against Ruptor's allegations that the 
SecurID is unsafe or cryptographically compromised, and not credit my 
facts.  All the better if they choose to look further into what Mr. 
Lancelot describes -- with his fabled objectivity -- as this 
discussion of &quot;flaws in [a] commercial cryptographic product.&quot;

Would the interests of this forum, or it's readers, be better served 
if no one could present more complete, or more accurate, facts in 
response to Marcos el Ruptor's allegations of SecurID insecurity?

Was it unclear to anyone, other than Mr. Lancelot, that I have a 
commercial association with RSA -- and, perhaps, a better than 
average knowledge of the facts relevant to the issue raised?

Despite Lancelot's insinuations to the contrary, I'm certain that 
most readers, here as elsewhere, would rather make a judgements about 
contentious issues with more facts --even facts supplied by people 
who acknowledge they work with a vendor -- rather than less facts.

(With regard to the SID800 furor that Mr. Lancelot refers to, I just 
didn't have time to get into a prolonged flame-fest with Thor, last 
fall, when I posted an explanation of what RSA was offering as new 
option in it's hybrid SecurIDs: USB plugs with both local storage and 
a microchip, and a displayed SecurID token-code LCD. The 
controversial part was a site-selectable option which allowed a local 
client to pull a SecurID token-code from the USB plug on demand, just 
as it could access typical smartcard functions from the USB. [On 
this, I did go back to RSA product managers to learn more about what 
the product entailed.]

(I argued that RSA's customers had asked for it, for sites in 
transition from OTP to PKI, and that their risk analysis should be 
respected. That risk, I also noted, seemed no greater than with a PKI 
smartcard, where a client or the OS can also access the smartcard for 
authentication and other PKI functions. There was no &quot;secret 
vulnerability,&quot; and no &quot;locked-in&quot; choices: RSA itself offers a 
multitude of alternative authentication schemes, some more robust, some less.

(Unfortunately, this was one of those funny moments in IT history 
where a vendor, making one in a chain of product development 
decisions, finds that it has deeply offended a cadre of tech savants. 
Some seemed to feel that RSA was pissing in the holy grail by 
offering yet another SecurID product choice that traded relative 
security for more flexibility. I could empathize, actually. I felt 
something similar a decade back, when RSA first offer token-emulation 
code, OTP generation in software, in addition to its SecurID hardware 
tokens. I argued against it for years. Over the years, however, the 
clearest message from the authentication market is that customers 
demand an array of options. No one tech fits all environs.

(For all that, the post that Mr. Lancelot recalls with such rancor 
was not my best effort. It was originally written for other forums, 
where there were lot of confused RSA customers online in a big mix of 
technical and executive talent. I didn't take the time to craft a 
more concise version for Cryptography, as I should have.  If I had, I 
would have omitted a lot of the broader-context stuff that Mr. 
Lancelot and others read as marketing fluff. We would have still 
disagreed, but perhaps less so. As an explanation, it was very 
helpful elsewhere -- but here the reaction quickly degenerated into 
absolutist declarations about SecurID product purity and ad hominem 
attacks. I was, frankly, too busy to deal with it.)

It's a lazy Labor Day here in the States; not a bad day to defend a 
career. Overall, for what its worth, I'm quite proud of my long 
association with RSA. I've been a part of its history, and it's been 
a lot of fun. I feel I've contributed something useful to the 
industry and to the Net.  YMMV.

Suerte,
            _Vin
