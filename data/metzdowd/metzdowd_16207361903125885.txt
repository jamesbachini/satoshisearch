I'm running Firefox 3.0.1 on (Gentoo) Linux and had coincidentally just
gone through this process.

When adding an exception for a site with an invalid security certificate
there is a checkbox at the bottom of the &quot;Add Security Exception&quot; window
that gives you the option to permanently store the exception. It is
checked by default, but the option not to do so is there (and works!)
