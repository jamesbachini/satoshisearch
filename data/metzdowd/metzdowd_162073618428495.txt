Indeed.

I fear I was not clear: I don't see what is wrong in evaluating the
quality of a random number generator with (an extensive set of)
statistical tests.

For sure, it would be better if we could check the source code and
match the implemented RNG against an already known RNG.

But, then, there is a &quot;the chicken or the egg&quot; problem: how would you
ensure that a *new* RNG is a good source of &quot;randomness&quot; ? (it's not a
rhetorical questions, I'm curious about other approaches).
