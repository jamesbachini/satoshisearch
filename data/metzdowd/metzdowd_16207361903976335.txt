I don't disagree that much more needs to be done on human factors. I
just don't see it as a panacea. I also think understanding just how
little you can expect from the users, and what the limits are, is
critical.

I have a friend who's mother got conned after a stroke left her
excessively credulous. He arranged for caretakers to read all her
physical and electronic mail before letting her have it. Understanding
the limitations of your user community is important.
