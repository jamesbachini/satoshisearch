      &quot;News

National Information Assurance Strategy launched 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/csia/national_ia_strategy/index.asp">http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/csia/national_ia_strategy/index.asp</A>&gt;
On 27th June, a National Information Assurance Strategy was launched at 
the IA07 event in Brighton. The annual event is hosted by CESG and 
brings together key players in industry and government to work in 
partnership to address the UK&#146;s needs in safeguarding information and ICT.&quot;


The document is available at: 
<A HREF="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/csia/national_ia_strategy/index.asp">http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/csia/national_ia_strategy/index.asp</A> . I 
haven't read it yet, and so cannot comment, but in a related area I'm 
puzzled: having heard that Cabinet Office will be supporting Cabinet, I 
wonder what will happen to all the technical stuff such as Govt Gateway 
and even CSIA.
