Steve Bellovin documents on his blog a recent attempt by Amtrak to
teach its customers to be phishing victims:

My comments:

&quot;Phish someone, and you inconvenience him for a week.
 Teach a man to be phished, and you screw him for the rest of his life.&quot;
                --me

I got the exact same email from Amtrak. It is pretty disappointing to
me, but sadly not surprising, that big organizations are still
conditioning their users to become fraud victims.
