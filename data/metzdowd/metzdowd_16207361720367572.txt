I think that it's clear that people were shocked when Max released his
work. Many people may discount the work if they (say like many
Thinkpads) do not have at IEEE 1394 port. This is of course not going to
stop someone from inserting a cardbus card. Furthermore, I think Max
didn't manage to demonstrate a contradiction to a commonly held thought.

I'm sure it was no surprise to FreeBSD kernel developers that you could
use Firewire to read kernel memory structures using DMA.

I think the most important aspect of this work is that by using
redundant (all Hail Nadia Heninger) keying information in memory we can
recover and make a pretty good confirmation. This means we don't have to
do reverse engineering to find keys and we can correct for errors.

Our keyfinder could be used with firewire and I think it stands on its own.
