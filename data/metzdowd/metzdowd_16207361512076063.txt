One wonders if it was their attorneys who suggested that they confirm
categorically that &quot;x OR y&quot; -- never mind that no malicious activities
being &quot;attributed&quot; (by whom? to whom? &quot;attribute&quot; takes a subject and an
object, and neither is optional!  note the passive voice!) doesn't mean,
of course, that none occurred, nor than none were discovered by others
or even by Skype itself.

Reads like classic corporate weasel-wording to me.
