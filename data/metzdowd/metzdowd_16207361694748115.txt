<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; E.g., here's such a specfication excerpt and is absolutely everything said in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the spec wrt obtaining said signature keys:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   When generating MAC keys, the recommendations in [RFC1750] SHOULD be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; followed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One point, RFC1750 has been superceded by RFC4086.
</I>
I'll point that out, thanks.


&gt;<i> &gt;   ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   The quality of the protection provided by the MAC depends on the randomness of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the shared MAC key, so it is important that an unguessable value be used.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How (un)wise is this, in a real-world sense? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems pretty reasonable to me. They are referring to an RFC with
</I>&gt;<i> lots of good advice about random number generators, and they emphasize
</I>&gt;<i> that the key value should be unguessable. It's probably out of scope to
</I>&gt;<i> go into a lot more detail than that. Referring to other standards like
</I>&gt;<i> RFC1750/4086 is the right way to handle this kind of issue.
</I>
agreed (thx for the ptr to RFC4880) after doing some further reading and such. 
RFC4086 covers the notion of &quot;mixing functions&quot; etc, so the above-quoted 
SHOULD statement covers those bases.



&gt;<i> I am the co-author of the OpenPGP Standard, RFC4880. All we say is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        The sending OpenPGP generates a random number to be used as a
</I>&gt;<i>        session key for this message only.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    * Certain operations in this specification involve the use of random
</I>&gt;<i>      numbers.  An appropriate entropy source should be used to generate
</I>&gt;<i>      these numbers (see [RFC4086]).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not all that different in thrust than the spec you are looking at.
</I>

agreed, thanks again.
