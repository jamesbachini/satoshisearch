    Peter&gt; discussion about FF3 removing the FF2 SSL indicators of the
    Peter&gt; padlock and (more visibly) the background colour-change for
    Peter&gt; the URL bar when SSL is active and replacing it with a
    Peter&gt; spoof-friendly indicator that's part of the favicon,
    Peter&gt; i.e. part of the attacker-controlled content.  The URL bar

    Peter&gt; that any web browser had, the giant leap backwards of
    Peter&gt; moving to a near-invisible blue border around the favicon
    Peter&gt; does nothing to indicate security and is trivially spoofed
    Peter&gt; by putting a blue border around the favicon.  There's a
    Peter&gt; bugzilla bug filed against it,

Comments need to be received by September 15. The draft is at
