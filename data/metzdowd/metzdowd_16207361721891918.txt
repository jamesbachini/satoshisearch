<PRE>Dear all,

[Apologies if you get multiple copies of this email.]

Mixmaster 3.0 has been released this week. This is the first major version
release since 2.9, and a continuation of that code, though it incorporates
numerous improvements, feature enhancements, and bug-fixes. It is
recommended that you upgrade your remailers to this version.

For those of you running 3.0rc1 or one of the 3.0 beta releases, the
changes are minor, though upgrading is still recommended.

Please report any problems you experience to the Mixmaster maintainers
through the bug tracker at SourceForge. (<A HREF="http://sf.net/projects/mixmaster">http://sf.net/projects/mixmaster</A>).

The code can be found there as well, and is signed by the Mixmaster 3.x
release key, found on <A HREF="http://mixmaster.sf.net">http://mixmaster.sf.net</A> and signed by myself and
numerous other cypherpunks. Any questions regarding tampering with the
source code should be reported as soon as noticed.

There are some user-facing improvements as well, though most of the
planned client improvements have been pushed off to 3.1. For stability
reasons, users of the client are encouraged to upgrade as well. (Users of
third-party GUIs for Mixmaster are encouraged to report their success or
problems with detailed bug reports if applicable.)

We're looking forward to your feedback!


Best regards, on behalf of the Mixmaster Development Team:

Steve Crook
Peter Palfrader
