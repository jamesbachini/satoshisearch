You have given english sentence of 12 words as passphrase. If we count
about 2.5bits of information per word and hash without adding salt, it
results in about 2^30 combinations. When we divide it over botnet of
1000 computers, each must try about 10^6 hashes. I guess you can
calculate the rest of the anwers.
