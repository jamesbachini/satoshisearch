Schlage Introduces Innovative Web- and Mobile Phone-controlled Locks

CARMEL, Ind., Sept. 3 -- Schlage, the most trusted brand of door locks,
today unveiled the latest consumer electronic innovation that fuses home
security and automation with mobile technology. The new Schlage LiNK
deadbolts and locks provide homeowners the power to remotely control and
monitor access to their home 24/7 with any web-enabled mobile phone or
computer.

The new Schlage LiNK deadbolts and locks provide keyless entry through
4-digit access codes that can be entered, activated, deleted or  
disabled on
the lock's 11-digit push button keypad, or via the Schlage LiNK web  
portal
or mobile application.

This solution gives homeowners the freedom of never having to carry or
circulate multiple sets of keys, coupled with the ability to
instantaneously grant access to family members, friends, unexpected  
house
guests, and service providers such as handymen and housekeepers.

Via the Schlage LiNK online portal, homeowners also have the control  
to set
up user codes for specific days and times, receive text or e-mail
notifications when certain codes are used and track codes that have been
used over the past 90 days. These features deliver peace of mind to the
parents of active families so they know exactly when their children,  
family
members, friends and even service providers are entering their home. It
also does away with the need to regularly replace locks for rental
properties and second homes.

&quot;Schlage LiNK deadbolts and locks give homeowners the control and  
peace of
mind of always knowing that even if their home is not in sight, it's  
never
out of reach,&quot; says Dwight Gibson, general manager, Intelligent  
Residential
Security, for Ingersoll Rand, the parent company of Schlage. &quot;Schlage  
has
been the leading lock brand for the residential security market for more
than 85 years and we are dedicated to continually developing product
innovations that not only deliver first-rate security but also add
convenience to our customers' busy lives.&quot;

Additional product attributes include:

-- Schlage LiNK locks are the first Z-Wave-enabled locks and work
seamlessly with more than 300 other Z-Wave-enabled home automation  
devices
including products ranging from lighting and temperature to pool and spa
controls.

-- The Schlage LiNK web portal utilizes the same Secure Socket Layer  
(SSL)
protection used by the banking industry and the Z-Wave Bridge's RF  
signals
are fully encrypted using AEC 128 bit encryption protocols.

-- Designed with plug and play simplicity, the wireless Z-Wave Bridge
easily plugs into an Ethernet port on the home computer's Internet  
router
and the light module plugs into any standard 3 prong electrical outlet.

-- Schlage LiNK locks are powered by regular batteries and typically
install in less than 30 minutes with only a screwdriver.

-- The Schlage LiNK Starter Kit retails for $299 and includes one  
Schlage
LiNK deadbolt or lock, a wireless Z-Wave Bridge and a compatible light
module. Additional Schlage LiNK deadbolts or locks will retail for $199.

-- There is also a $12.99 monthly subscription fee for use of the  
Schlage
LiNK online portal and mobile applications. With the monthly  
subscription,
homeowners also receive 100 MB of memory to store IP camera video, if
installed with the system.

-- Schlage LiNK deadbolts and locks can be used anywhere in the home a
traditional lock is used and are available in bright brass, satin nickel
and aged bronze, to complement any decor.

Schlage LiNK deadbolts and locks will be available at Fry's Electronics
Retail Stores, on Fry's web site (www.frys.com) and through select
professional builders in late October.
