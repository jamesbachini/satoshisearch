True enough, but the &quot;clickthru bandits&quot; will just see a button that
reads to them &quot;make this error go away&quot; then next time will forget they
did it - and will take the fact that they went straight into the site to
mean the problem was &quot;fixed&quot; or simply not remember there ever was a
problem.

In the meantime, a choice I *used to have* is now taken from me, in the
interests of selling more EV certificates.
