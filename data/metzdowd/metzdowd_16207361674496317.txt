the other claim was that it was assumed that basic systems were built to 
be secure,
so it would have been quite foreign idea it would be necessary to build 
a secure
specific system.

besides the referenced fairly wide use of gov and commercial 
institutions requiring
high integrity systems ... the early virtual machine systems (cp67 and 
vm370)
were also used by commercial time-sharing service bureaus. most of these
created cms &quot;padded cell&quot; modifications, a lot of it was to prevent 
users from
damaging themselves (as opposed to the underlying security that prevented
uses from damaging the system and/or each other).

at least some of these services provided online, concurrent services to
(competitive) wall street firms ... who would be using the online services
for highly sensitive financial activities (as example of integrity 
requirements).
