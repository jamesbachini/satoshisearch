Hmm... I'm not sure I recognize the difference between encryption
scheme and cipher. Can you elaborate?

I suppose it depends what you mean by &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot;.

A lot of the relevant values are things like SSNs, CCNs, etc.
which fall in the 10-20 digit category, where the Luby-Rackoff
approach is efficient. As I understand the situation, the
cycle following approach is efficient as long as the set
is reasonably close to the L-R block size. 

As far as dictionary attacks go, for any small domain permutation
you have to worry about table construction attacks. The only 
defense I know of is randomized encryption which defeats the
non-expansion requirement.

WRT to the security of the L-R construction, Spies claims that
I believe that Patarin's 2004 result [0] is relevant here, but
I'm not qualified to evaluate it. Anyway, the reference I provided
earlier [1] provides a summary of the claimed security properties
of L-R + Cycle Following.
