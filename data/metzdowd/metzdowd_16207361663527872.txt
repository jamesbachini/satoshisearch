Certainly, but then neither does a one-person login (people can
always log into a system and then walk away to get a cup of coffee,
for that matter).

Of course, this is common sense. These are human problems which I do
not think can *ever* be solved through application of cryptography.
As I said, requiring two sets of credentials can act as a reminder
to work together, nothing more. There's no way that I know of to
force a person to pay attention, or for that matter do anything they
do not wish to do.

Agreed--it would be nonsense to dream otherwise. My only point was
to suggest that there are some circumstances in which a system like
this can be helpful/useful, which was one of the questions John
asked. It is simply necessary that when employing such a system, you
be aware of what problems it actually *can* solve, and what problems
it cannot. I have no doubt that some people attempt to employ these
sorts of solutions in ways which they are indeed inapplicable (or
put too much faith in the false sense of security it gives them),
possibly at the urging of their snake oil vendors. This is why
scrutiny of the *application* of a technology is at least as
important as scrutiny of the technology itself.
