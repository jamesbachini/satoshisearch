The problem, Peter, is that people who don't know you may mistake your
sarcasm for agreement with misconception in the article Arshad quoted.

Oh, and by the way, you missed half a dozen failed secure mail
protocols, SET (the Wikipedia article for SET really needs to be
changed from present to past tense), and 20 other easy examples. It is
sort of like shooting fish in a barrel, isn't it?

The point is not that fools (often including us) haven't built
monstrous ziggurats that failed. The point is that no one rational
should *SEEK* to make a protocol into monstrous ziggurat on the basis
that this will improve security, and don't pretend you don't agree,
because most of us know you better than that.
