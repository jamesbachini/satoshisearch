<PRE>I do not believe the mentioned conflict exists.  The aim of these
calculator-like devices is to make sure that no malware, virus etc can
create unauthorized transactions.  The user should still be able to
debug, and inspect the software in the calculator-like device, or
virtual software compartment, just that installation of software or
upgrades into that area should be under direct explicit user control.
(eg with BIOS jumper required to even make any software change!)

The ring -1 and loss-of-control aspects of TPM are different, they are
saying that you are not really root on your own machine anymore!  In
the sense that if you do load under a debugger the remote party can
tell this and refuse to talk with you.

This remote attestation feature is simply not required for
user-centric, user-controlled security.
