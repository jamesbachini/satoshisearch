Well, I wouldn't say they aren't custodians. Perhaps not in the 
sense that the word is commonly used, but most certainly in the 
sense custodians of the wisdom used to make the choices. This is 
exemplified by Bruce Schneier, an &quot;acknowledged expert,&quot;  changing 
his mind about the way to do security from &quot;encrypt everything&quot; to 
&quot;monitor everything.&quot; Yes, I have simplified his stance, but just to 
make the point that even experts learn and change over time.

Actually I think it is just about as difficult to tell who is a 
trustworthy expert in the field of cryptography as it is in any 
field of science or medicine. Just look at the junk science and 
medical studies. One retrospective study of 90+ clinical trials 
found that over 600 potentially important reaction to the drugs 
occurred but only 39 were reported in the papers. I suspect if we 
did the same sort of retrospective study for cryptography we would 
find some similar issues, just, perhaps, not as large because there 
is not as much money to be made with junk cryptography as junk 
pharmaceuticals.

I'm curious, how does software get sold for so long that is clearly 
weak or broken? Detected, yes, but still sold like Windows LANMAN 
backward compatibility.

&gt;<i> When it comes to expertise in crypto, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes

</I>
Well, Nico, this is where I diverge from your view. It is the 
&quot;police departments, financial organizations, intelligence 
organizations, etc...&quot; who deploy the cryptography. Why should they 
be able to do that any better than they do anything else? I suspect 
that a weakness in oversight in one area is likely to reflect a 
weakness in others as well. Not total failure, just not done the 
best possible.

Best,

Allen
