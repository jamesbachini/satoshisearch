A couple years ago I got a letter from E-Z Pass a few days after I
used my transponder in my new car without registering my new car. They
gave me a grace period to register before making me pay some sort of
penalty.

So, I believe, at least for E-Z Pass, the attack would have to include
cloning the license plate and pictures may still be available whenever
a victim realizes they have been charged for trips they did not take.
