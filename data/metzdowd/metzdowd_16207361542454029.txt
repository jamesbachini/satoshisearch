  Well, if fingerprint scanners aren't reliable enough to identify the same
person accurately twice, it's even moreso snake oil to suggest they're
suitable for crypto... or even biometric authentication, for that.

  (I wonder if the level of variability is manageable enough that you could
generate a set of the most-probable variations of the trace of a given
fingerprint and then use a multiple key/N-out-of-M technique.)
