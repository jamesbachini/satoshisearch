Title: Traitor Tracing for Anonymous Attack in AACS Content Protection

Speaker: Hongxia Jin, IBM Almaden

Abstract:

Broadcast encryption and traitor tracing are two active problems in
cryptography community.  In this talk I will give an overview on how
broadcast encryption and traitor tracing can be used for content
protection.  My focus of the talk is on tracing traitors for anonymous
attack. It is a way to trace the source of unauthorized copies of the
content or content encrypting keys when the system is broadcasted.  I
will give the talk in the context of AACS, the new industry content
protection standards for next generation high definition DVDs, It is
the first large-scale commercial deployment of  a traitor tracing
technology.  Along the way we have had to solve both practical and
theoretical problems that had not been apparent in the literature to
date.  In this talk I will focus on addressing some of those problems
in our process of bringing a theoretical solution to practice.
