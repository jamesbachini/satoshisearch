To paraphrase Winston Churchill, &quot;SSL is the worst secure-pipe protocol,
except for all the others&quot;.  Like most people here, I can find assorted nits
to pick with it (mostly message-formatting stuff and the like, which is
actually relatively trivial), but every time I look at its competitors I
realise that they're all much, much worse.  Conversely, it's amazing how many
other protocols are just SSL reinvented badly (or in several cases, really
really badly).
