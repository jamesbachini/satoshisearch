  &gt; Sun's &quot;Secure NFS&quot; product from the 1980s had 192-bit Diffie-Hellman,
  &gt; and a comment in one of the O'Reilly NFS books says that
  &gt;          &quot;However, by 1990, advances in RISC processors produced
  &gt;          workstation machines that could, by brute force,
  &gt;          derive the private key from any public key in under a day.&quot;
  &gt; but that in 1987 there were still a lot of Motorola 68010 machines
  &gt; that took several minutes to generate keys so they didn't want it
  &gt; longer. I'm guessing that a 1990 RISC machine was around 50 MIPS,
  &gt; so it's maybe 1/100 the speed of a modern single-core CPU.
  &gt; 
  &gt; 128-bit DH sounds like as good a decision as using 40-bit RC4 keys
  &gt; would be today.
  &gt; 
  It wasn't just brute force, it was math.
