An interesting variant on biometrics, can't easily be reproduced with
pieces of one's body separated from the whole, and involves in part
something remembered. No hard numbers were provided on FP/FN rates.  Also,
no mention of how &quot;compexity rules&quot; might be handled. CISOs might not
be too happy without a warm fuzzy that their users have decent passwords
on their BlackBerry devices. Is my &quot;X&quot; more secure than your &quot;X&quot;?

This may not work for everyone, some people are more verbal-sequential
than visual-spatial. I for one don't really have a stable hand-written
signature, but have no problem memorizing long passwords (and can store
them in a password-safe).
