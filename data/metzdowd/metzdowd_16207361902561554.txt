<PRE>
I am considering adding TLS Server Name Indication support in the Postfix
SMTP server and client. I am puzzled by the exceedingly terse description
of the semantics of the HostName sent in the SNI extension:

    <A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1</A>

       If the hostname labels contain only US-ASCII characters, then the
       client MUST ensure that labels are separated only by the byte 0x2E,
       representing the dot character U+002E (requirement 1 in Section 3.1
       of [IDNA] notwithstanding).  If the server needs to match the
       HostName against names that contain non-US-ASCII characters, it MUST
       perform the conversion operation described in Section 4 of [IDNA],
       treating the HostName as a &quot;query string&quot; (i.e., the AllowUnassigned
       flag MUST be set).  Note that IDNA allows labels to be separated by
       any of the Unicode characters U+002E, U+3002, U+FF0E, and U+FF61;
       therefore, servers MUST accept any of these characters as a label
       separator.  If the server only needs to match the HostName against
       names containing exclusively ASCII characters, it MUST compare ASCII
       names case-insensitively.

At least the Postfix SMTP client does not normally work with IDNA domains
directly. In queued email messages the recipient domain is already ACE
encoded, e.g. &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">postmaster at xn--exmple-cua.com</A>&gt;. Suppose Postfix is configured
to establish a TLS secure-channel with a mail server for this domain, and
now wants to signal the required certificate name to the receiving SMTP
server.

What should the SMTP client put in the RFC 4366 section 3.1 &quot;HostName&quot;:

    - The ACE domain it is working with (xn--exmple-cua.com)?
    - The underlying UTF8 domain name? (ex&#228;mple.com)?

What should the server do when it receives the client's &quot;HostName&quot;?

    - Convert ACE to UTF8?
    - Convert UTF8 to ACE?

When searching for certificates with matching domain names, the receiving
server may need to look at:

    &lt;<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-7.1">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-7.1</A>&gt;:
	subject CommonName rDNs, which may contain UTF8 strings

    &lt;<A HREF="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-7.2">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-7.2</A>&gt;:
	subject Alternative Name v3 extensions which contain IA5 (ASCII)
	domain names.

What type of comparison is the server expected to perform?

    - Convert UTF8 CommanName to ACE (also leave IA5 alone) and then compare?
    - Convert ACE names in either subjectAltName or CN to UTF8 and then
      compare UTF8 strings (with NAMEPREP, STRINGPREP and all that jazz)?

This can be (to say the least) rather unpleasant. If IDNA is only between
the user and the UI, with everything on the wire in ACE form, then all
the pain is avoided:

	- 4366 client sends ACE
	- 4366 server uses received string uninterpreted
	- Certificates contain ACE names in subjectAltName AND also in
          the CommonName where the name in question is a domain name.
	- Server just does case insensitive search on ASCII strings.

If instead, client and server have to jump through hoops doing (tersely
specified, and unlikely IMHO to inter-operate) IDNA conversions, then I
may just bag the whole idea and do something more useful.

Anyone have any insight on what implementations are supposed to do?
