<PRE>&gt;<i>EE Times: Toshiba tips random-number generator IC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   SAN FRANCISCO -- Toshiba Corp. has claimed a major breakthrough in
</I>&gt;<i>   the field of security technology: It has devised the world's
</I>&gt;<i>   highest-performance physical random-number generator (RNG)
</I>&gt;<i>   circuit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The device generates random numbers at a data rate of 2.0 megabits
</I>&gt;<i>   a second, according to Toshiba in a paper presented at the
</I>&gt;<i>   International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) here.

I'm wondering if they've considered the possibility of EMI skewing the
operation of the device, or other means of causing the device to
genearate &quot;less than completely random&quot; numbers.

It is certainly an interesting device; I think this would find
considerable use in communication infrastructure and high-bandwidth
applications.  As someone else mentioned, generating a single, random,
128 bit seed is not too difficult with current technology, but it
doesn't address the issue that often times you want more than just a
single key.  One of the problems with the Linux random number generator
is that it happens to be quite slow, especially if you need a lot of
data.

Some potential uses:
1.) Secure file erasure.
2.) OTP keygen for those _really_ high security applications.
3.) Faster symmetric keyset generation.  You know, when you need to
build 32k keys...
4.) Random seeding of communication packets.

There used to be (maybe still) a TCP spoofing exploit that relied on the
timing of packets; there are also various de-anonymization attacks based
on clock skew.  With a chip like this, you could add a small, random
number to the timestamp, or even packet delay, and effectively thwart
such attacks.  Such systems need high-bandwidth, random number
generators.
