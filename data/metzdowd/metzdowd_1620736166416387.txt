Here is another one: Barclays use the Visa method, which was initially 
called Visa Wave, and early news of it came out of Singapore.

Both methods (Mastercard and Visa) should work through the same 
terminal, but I don't yet have proof.

Then there is a independent contactless card e-money scheme called sQuid 
just launching (squidcard.com), and they will want to use the same 
terminals...
