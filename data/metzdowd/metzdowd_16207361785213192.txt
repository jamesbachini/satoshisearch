<PRE>
Just a few reminders from your moderator about posting etiquette:

0) Text only, please. HTML and text encoded weird ways like base-64,
   as well as MIME multiparts, are a big pain in the neck. I generally
   just reject them rather than repairing them.
1) Please do not top post when replying to other people.
2) If you're replying to someone else's email, edit down the quoted
   text to the minimum needed for comprehension.
3) Try to be concise.
