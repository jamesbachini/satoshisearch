</I>You've given a wish list but you haven't explained why you think it
will happen.  The US government walked away from the issue years ago,
when the Clipper chip effort failed.  Even post-9/11, the Bush
administration chose not to revisit the question.

The real issue, though, is technical rather than political will.  CALEA
is a mandate for service providers; key escrow is a requirement on the
targets of the surveillance.  The bad guys won't co-operate...
