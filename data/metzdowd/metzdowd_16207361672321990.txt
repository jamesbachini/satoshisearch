Huh? What are you claiming the problem with sending client certificates
in plaintext is (as if anyone uses client certificates anyway)? 
That the phisher gets to see the client's identity? So what?
It doesn't let them impersonate the client to anyone. Certificates
shouldn't contain sensitive information anyway.

No it isn't more secure.

This gets discussed on the TLS mailing list occasionally, but the
arguments for making this change aren't very convincing. If you have
an actual credible security argument you should post it to

Whether this is true or not depends critically on the base rate
of errors in packets delivered to TCP by the IP layer, since
the rate of errors delivered to SSL is 1/256th of those delivered
to the TCP layer. Since link layer checksums are very common,
as a practical matter errored packets getting delivered to protocols
above TCP is quite rare.
