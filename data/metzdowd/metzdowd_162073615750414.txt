But if you build a FDE product with it you've got to get the entire product
certified, not just the crypto component.

(Actually given the vagueness of what's being certified you might be able to
get away with getting just one corner certified, but then if you have to use a
SISWG mode you'd need to modify OpenSSL, which in turn means getting another
certification.  Or the changes you'd need to make to get it to work as a
kernel driver would require recertification, because you can't just link in
libssl for that.  Or...).
