Saw an interesting free software example of this the other day (not
for Windows, of course) using loss of signal from a particular
bluetooth device (mobile phone, et cetera) to lock your machine or
run other designated commands:

   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/blueproximity/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/blueproximity/</A>

It also supports *unlocking* on approach, but that's a bad idea
unless they can start providing a client to run on the &quot;token&quot;
device (maybe using asymmetric key crypto to sign and verify a
challenge string instead of just looking for the device's BT
address).
