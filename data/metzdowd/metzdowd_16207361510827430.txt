  I was going to post about &quot;crypto done wrong&quot; after reading this item[*]:
<A HREF="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-082007.html#00001263">http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/archive-082007.html#00001263</A>

  I can't tell exactly what, but they have to be doing *something* wrong if
they think it's necessary to use file-hiding hooks to conceal... well,
anything really.  The hash of the fingerprint should be the symmetric key used
to encrypt either files and folders directly on the thumbdrive, or perhaps a
keyring file containing ADKs of some description, but if you do crypto right,
you shouldn't have to conceal or obfuscate anything at all.


    cheers,
