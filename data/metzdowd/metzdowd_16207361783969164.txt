(As a disclaimer, I've hacked a little on Tunnelblick (the mac os x GUI)
and I've talked at length with the creator of OpenVPN.)

I'm always curious to hear what designers of protocols actually use on a
daily basis. I'm also really curious how said designers evaluate their
choices.

I really like OpenVPN. It's really smooth to setup, it's very easy to
use on the Big Three Platforms.

Have you read the source to OpenVPN? Do you think that it's
cryptographically sound? Is it properly implemented?

I've found some stuff I wonder about and I'm curious if anyone else has?
