&gt;<i> Is anyone aware of any third-party usability studies on CardSpace, 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenID, ...?).
</I>
I'm not.  It would be a good opportunity for security usability 
researchers to contribute though.

&gt;<i> [0] I'm not sure whether putting &quot;CardSpace&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot; in such close
</I>&gt;<i>    proximity in the above line was a good idea.  If your monitor starts
</I>&gt;<i>    smoking due to the friction generated, please cut&amp;paste one of the two
</I>&gt;<i>    elsewhere.

Actually lots of Liberty and WS/Infocard/etc people are working on interop 
scenarios, see:
