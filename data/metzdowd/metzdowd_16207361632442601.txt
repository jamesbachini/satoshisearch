In this context, the only thing that guards agains an attack by
&quot;some person&quot; is the faint hope that she can't predict the Tn
that the notary will use for a Dp that she submits.

That's because if Tn is known (including chosen) to &quot;some person&quot;,
then (due to the weakness in MD5 we are talking about), she can
generate Dp and Dp' such that
  S( MD5(Tn || Dp || Cp || Cn) ) = S( MD5(Tn || Dp' || Cp || Cn) )
whatever Cp, Cn and S() are.

If Tn was hashed after Dp rather than before, poof goes security.
