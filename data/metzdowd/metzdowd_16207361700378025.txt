Their key recovery technique gets a lot of mileage from using the
computed key schedule for each round of AES or DES to provide
redundant copies of the bits of the key.  If the computer cleared
the key schedule storage, while keeping the key itself when the
system is in sleep mode, or when the screen-saver password mode
kicks in, this attack would be less possible.

If, in addition, the key was kept XORed with the secure hash of a
large block of random memory, as suggested in their countermeasures
section, their attacks would be considerably more difficult.

These seem to be simple, low overhead countermeasures that provide
value for machines like laptops in transit.
