The initial WEP design was done without cryptography experts. The
design of subsequent generations of WiFi security was designed in the
face of backward compatibility constraints that severely limited the
space of possible designs.

I would claim that this is not an example of crypto experts getting it
wrong at all -- it is, in fact, an example of what can go wrong when
people who don't know what they're doing design cryptography into
something that's very widely deployed.
