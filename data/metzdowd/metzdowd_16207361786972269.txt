&gt;<i>   Research In Motion (RIM), the Canadian company behind the BlackBerry

If you look closely, there's no contradiction.  Non-enterprise customers
don't run their own gateway, so RIM just acts as a telco, which
naturally has got access to all the data.  The Indian government doesn't
need &quot;special access&quot;, either, because Lawful Intercept services etc.
aren't that special anymore.
