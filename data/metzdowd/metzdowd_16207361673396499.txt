Ah.  Jane need not have a requirement to know what Joe is doing;
in fact, Jane may not even be cleared for Joe's material.  (This
is not uncommon.  Jane may be security officer, Joe may be payroll
manager.  Jane is not authorized to see payroll data or even
use the payroll &quot;joe&quot; account.)

What has transpired is that Joe cannot deny that he was logged on.
He can further deny that other logins that he did not perform were
done by him, assuming Jane is honest.  Jane can attest that the
login by user joe was done by human Joe.

Correct.  Logins by Joe-impersonators, even those who have stolen
Joe's password, say, are impossible without Jane's collusion.

This is sounding something like the FBI's method for getting at
certain sensitive info, that was recently subjected to criticism.
There was only one account to access the data, all operatives had
the password.  Adding &quot;Jane&quot; sounds like an inept fix.
