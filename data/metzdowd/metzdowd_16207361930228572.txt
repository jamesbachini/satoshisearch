<PRE>For the past several years I've been making a point of asking users of crypto 
on embedded systems (which would be particularly good targets for side-channel 
attacks, particularly ones that provide content-protection capabilities) 
whether they'd consider enabling side-channel attack (SCA - no, not that SCA) 
protection in their use of crypto.  So far I've never found anyone who's made 
an informed decision to trade off performance for SCA protection.  By 
&quot;informed decision&quot; I mean the following:

- SCA protection isn't enabled by default, i.e. they don't just get it whether 
  they want it or not.

- The SCA protection is more than just a token throw-some-blinding-at-the-RSA, 
  it extends to things like pubic/private key validation on load (for example 
  via MACs) to detect key-manipulation attacks, checksumming of key data after 
  each crypto op to detect memory-disturb attacks, and so on.

- There is a tangible cost/tradeoff in enabling SCA protection, i.e. it's not 
  just chicken-soup protection, &quot;turn it on, it's a 2GHz multicore CPU it 
  can't hurt&quot;.

In other words the user has to make a conscious decision that SCA protection 
is important enough that performance/power consumption can be sacrificed for 
it.  Can anyone provide any data on users making this tradeoff?  And since 
negative results are also results, a response of &quot;I've never found anyone who 
cares either&quot; is also useful.  Since the information may be commercially 
sensitive, respond in private email if you'd rather not discuss it in public 
and I'll summarise if there's any interest.

(Pre-emptive response to the inevitable &quot;OpenSSL/NSS/xyz smart card/... have 
had RSA blinding enabled by default since ...&quot;: Yes, I know, and now go back 
and re-read points 1 and 2 above).
