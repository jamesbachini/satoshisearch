In a CA I have something to do with, I'm observing a site 
that just started experimenting with client certs (100 
users, will reach 1000, maybe more).

When we discovered that the certificate includes PII 
(personally identifying information) and the website stores 
additional PII, the service was directed to drop all 
additional PII, and some thought was put into the in-cert PII.

Current view is that the service must engage the user in a 
contract to accept the storing of that in-cert PII, 
otherwise it must not store the info in the cert (which 
means no identity, no persistence, and no point to the 
client certs).

Writing contracts and securing agreement of course is a 
barrier, a burden.  If this were a general requirement, then 
this would be enough (imho) to not recommend client certs, 
because contracts need lawyers, they cost real money, they 
don't solve the problem, and not recommending them is 
likewise unacceptable.

(Then, as you say, there are convenience issues.)

This is an experiment to force client certs to be used, so 
they are plugging on.  It's a CA so it is trying to prove 
that there is value in these things.

So... there are two slight variations that could be 
employed.  Firstly, all data placed in the cert could be 
declared public in advance, and then no contract is required 
to use it in a context that is compatible with public data. 
  That is, the question of the contract is pushed to the CA/CPS.

(You mentioned that the premise is that it is all public 
data...)

Another variation is to switch to username + password, of 
course, in which case the username is freely given and 
expected to be stored (certs being more or less invisible to 
users, so we can presume no such).

(definately open to other ideas...)

The PII equation is particularly daunting, echoing Lynn's 
early '90s experiences.  I am told (but haven't really 
verified) that the certificate serial number is PII and 
therefore falls under the full weight of privacy law &amp; regs 
... this may sound ludicrous, but privacy and security are 
different fields with different logics.  If that is true, 
the liability is far too high for something that should be 
private, but is already public by dint of its exposure in 
certificates.  Privacy liabilities are sky-high in some 
places, and not only that, they are incalculable, 
unknowable, and vary with the person you are talking to.

So a superficial conclusion would be &quot;don't use client 
certificates because of the privacy issues&quot; although the 
issues are somewhat more complex than &quot;PII revealed in SSL 
key exchange.&quot;

As I say, they'll plug on, as they need to prove that the 
cert is worth issuing.  It's a data point, no more, and it 
doesn't exactly answer your spec above.  But I'm having fun 
observing them trying to prove that client certs are worth 
any amount of effort.
