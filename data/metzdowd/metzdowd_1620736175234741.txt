&gt;&gt;<i>Adding a backdoor to chips is a different story, though, since that would

A backdoor -- hardware or software -- in a smart card or TPM would be
difficult to detect by either of these means.  In the case that nation A is
buying these from nation F, don't you think that nation F would be motivated
to slip in a couple extra lines of code or a couple extra 100 gates just in
case?  If A got into a tangle with C, F would in a very strong position.
