<PRE>another term you might look for (used in physical security and
financial controls)  is  &quot;dual custody&quot; or sometimes &quot;double custody&quot;.

		(if you're searching, add &quot; -child&quot;  or &quot;security&quot; for better search  
quality)

i don't see why the analogies are not apt.

one question is whether the two people can both perform their  
respective act independently
or whether they need to perform their act within a bounded time.

in the case of auditcon locks, for example, often used on the money  
safe part of atms:

these features are called

&quot;Supervisor/Subordinate Mode
Allows access by a subordinate only after being enabled by a  
supervisory combination. Once enabled, a subordinate user has access  
to the lock during any valid opening time.&quot;
[for example, this would be used in a supermarket if a manager wants  
to allow a subordinate to open the safe the next morning]
or

&quot;Dual Custody
Two Person Integrity, which requires two users to open the lock.&quot;

the x-09 (approved for use in us top secret) has three modes:
A-single combination code
b-Dual combination mode which allows access only when two different  
three number combinations are dialed within 10 seconds of one another
c-Supervisory/subordinate mode

</I>&gt;<i> -- et cetera.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is important to note that the aforementioned examples
</I>&gt;<i> all share an important property, as we see from the following:
</I>&gt;<i>  *) The parties give their approval _after_ the semantics has
</I>&gt;<i>   been fully determined.  It would defeat all security if two
</I>&gt;<i>   signatures were attached to a blank check or a blank PO.
</I>&gt;<i>  *) As a related point, the approval is attached to a particular
</I>&gt;<i>   transaction.  The approver is not merely certifying that Joe
</I>&gt;<i>   is really Joe, and is generally allowed to write checks
</I>&gt;<i>   (mere identification);  the approver is certifying that this
</I>&gt;<i>   particular check is OK.
</I>&gt;<i>  *) To say the same thing another way, there is no pretexting.
</I>&gt;<i>   There is no pretext for turning the keys on the missile launcher
</I>&gt;<i>   unless you intend to launch a missile.  The semantics of the
</I>&gt;<i>   keys is clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need to talk about threat models:
</I>&gt;<i>  a) The purveyors of the system in question don't have any clue
</I>&gt;<i>   as to what their threat model is.  I conjecture that they might
</I>&gt;<i>   be motivated by the non-apt analogies itemized above.
</I>&gt;<i>  b) In the system in question, there are myriad reasons why Joe
</I>&gt;<i>   would need to log in.  If Joe wanted to do something nefarious,
</I>&gt;<i>   it would take him less than a second to come up with a seemingly
</I>&gt;<i>   non-nefarious pretext.  When the approver approves Joe's login,
</I>&gt;<i>   the approver has no idea what the consequences of that approval
</I>&gt;<i>   will be.  The two-person login requires the approver to be
</I>&gt;<i>   present at login time, but does not require the approver to
</I>&gt;<i>   remain present, let alone take responsibility what Joe does
</I>&gt;<i>   after login.
</I>&gt;<i>  c) The only threat model I can come up with is the case where
</I>&gt;<i>   Joe's password has been compromised, and nobody else's has.
</I>&gt;<i>   Two-person login would provide an extra layer of security
</I>&gt;<i>   in this case.  This threat is real, but there are other ways
</I>&gt;<i>   of dealing with this threat (e.g. two-factor authentication)
</I>&gt;<i>   ... so this seems like quite a lame justification for the
</I>&gt;<i>   two-person login.
</I>&gt;<i>  d) Or have I overlooked something?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From the foregoing, you might conclude that the two-person login
</I>&gt;<i> system is worthless security theater ... but harmless security
</I>&gt;<i> theater, and therefore not worth worrying about either way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the plot thickens.  The purveyors have implemented two-person
</I>&gt;<i> login in a way that manifestly /reduces/ security.  Details
</I>&gt;<i> available on request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now I throw it open for discussion.  Is there any significant
</I>&gt;<i> value in two-person login?  That is, can you identify any threat
</I>&gt;<i> that is alleviated by two-person login, that is not more wisely
</I>&gt;<i> alleviated in some other way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, is there any advice you can give on how to do this right?
</I>&gt;<i> Any DOs and DON&quot;Ts?
