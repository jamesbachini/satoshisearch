Recognition = a channel of information
memory = a channel of information

When you look at trust in various contexts, you will still find the 
need to receive information from sources OTHER than the source you 
want to trust. You may use these channels under different names, such 
as memory which is a special type of output that serves as input at a 
later point in time.

The distinguishing aspect between information and trust is this: 
&quot;trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but 
cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that 
channel&quot;. In other words, self-assertions cannot transfer trust. 
&quot;Trust me&quot; is, actually, a good indication not to trust.

Yes, where recognition is the OTHER channel that tells you that the 
value (given in the original channel) is correct. Just the value by 
itself is not useful for communicating trust -- you also need 
something else (eg, a digital sig) to provide the OTHER channel of 
information.
