<PRE>
I apologize for misstating your name, Mr. Simon.

I thought I had answered your question. No one asked me to reply to 
Ruptor, or to you -- and you chose the tone of this exchange.  As I 
said, I would be shocked if anyone at RSA or EMC even knows about 
this discussion.

No one tells me what to post, or when to post. I've been doing this 
for a long time, and while I have to honor common-sense guidelines 
about secrets and upcoming products, I operate pretty independently 
when it comes to what I publish on the Net.

My words are my own -- but when it is on-topic, I try to offer RSA's 
perspective, if I know it, along with the facts, as I know them. 
Personally, I think discussions here, and elsewhere online, would be 
a lot more constructive if vendors did not shun the Net's open 
forums. I'm grateful that RSA gives me leave to talk publicly about 
their products and technologies. If I sound prideful in discussing 
those products, as Mr. Simon says, in some cases I've been working on 
them for decades.

I rarely initiate a discussion about RSA's products or 
technology.  As in this case, I almost always respond to questions, 
claims, or comments from others --- and the tone of these discussions 
is almost always set by others. I generally just try to be helpful 
and informative; relatively low-key.

Given my history, of course, it is also true that the product 
managers and others at RSA now expect me to contribute to any major 
online discussion about the RSA products. (I sometimes I decide it is 
counterproductive to do so.)  No one at RSA told me to get into the 
SID800 debate, but they were certainly not surprised when I showed up 
to ask about it.  As an internal consultant to RSA, I had some say in 
defining the SID800's evolving product specs. Some of what I 
suggested was adopted, some not.  Online, I tried to talk about the 
goals of the SID800 product that was the result of the process, the 
balance it struck between security and accessibility, and offered my 
interpretation of how it fit within the market.

Generally speaking, I don't expect to convert someone like Ruptor or 
Thor  -- who start with a strong bias about a particular product -- 
so I try to address myself to the much larger community that just 
reads a forum like this. I don't think anyone gains points with 
objective observers by being nasty or arrogant; I think you gain 
credibility by being honestly informative and helpful. I try.

Suerte,
            _Vin
