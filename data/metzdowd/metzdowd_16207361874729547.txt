In the above Dr Dobb's article from a little over a year ago, AMD Senior 
Fellow Leendert vanDoorn states &quot;the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
algorithm gets a factor of 5 performance improvement by using the new 
SSE5 extension&quot;.  However, glancing through the SSE5 specification, I 
can't see at all how such a dramatic speedup might be achieved.  Does 
anyone know any more, or can anyone see more than I can in the spec?
