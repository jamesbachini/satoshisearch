The calculus on AES may change in the nearish future: Intel is adding
AES instructions in upcoming processors, and AMD is adding another set
of instructions in SSE5 to assist AES implementations. AMD claims a 5x
speedup for AES using SSE5 versus plain x86-64 instructions [2], I
have not yet seen performance estimates for the Intel instructions.
