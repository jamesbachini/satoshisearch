Some years ago I talked to an ex-GTE person about law enforcement requiring
intercept capabilities to be built into phone switches.  His comments about
their approach to security (which he was responsible for) was: &quot;They were
absolutely clueless, they assumed you could put 'Police line do not cross'
tape on the intercept portions and everyone would dutifully keep out&quot;.  He'd
left by the time it was implemented, but since there was never any significant
budget allocated to securing the intercept capabilities the impression I got
was that it only had whatever the developers could bolt on with the least cost
and effort.
