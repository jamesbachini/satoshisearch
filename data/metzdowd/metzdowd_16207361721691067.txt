DNSSEC is &quot;working fine&quot; as a technology. However, it is worth 
remembering that it works based on digitally signing an entire zone - 
the state of the world being what it is, most people prohibit xfer so 
any other technology that would allow a zonewalk is not going to be 
deployed.

as far as I can tell, this is a basic design flaw, so isn't going to be 
rectified anytime soon.
