And, Wells Fargo will let you use your PIN as part of a lost password
procedure, although I believe they require a lot of other pieces of
information at the same time like account number, online account name
and SSN.

My experience with European banks is quite limited -- my consulting
practice is pretty much US centric. My general understanding, however,
is that they are doing better, not worse, with login security.

I knew part of it, but your additional information was worthwhile.
