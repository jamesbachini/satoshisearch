Using the prime number theorem you can get an estimate on the number  
of such pairs.  Prime number theorem says that there are asyptotically  
2^{512}/ln(2^{512}) primes less than 512 bits.  So there are roughly  
2^{512}/ln(2^{512}) - 2^{511}/ln(2^{511}) ~ 2^{511}/ln(2^{512} 512-bit  
primes.  Squaring this and dividing by two will give the approximate  
number of pairs - 2^{1021}/(ln(2^{512}))^2.

Generalizing this for a n-bit RSA modulus gives 2^{n-3}/(ln(2^{n/ 
2}))^2 expected pairs.

Of course, well-chosen RSA primes usually have some special properties  
so that (p-1) and (q-1) don't have too many small factors and so that  
(p-q) isn't smaller than 2^{n/4}, so the above figures might be off by  
a bit if you consider the resulting distribution.  But they should  
still be fairly close (maybe within a factor of ln(2^{n/2})?).
