</I>&gt;<i> I am not immediately aware of any known attacks that have been published

</I>&gt;<i> g_1,p_1,q_1,y_1 where y_1 = g_1^x mod p_1

</I>&gt;<i> This is obviously additional information, and with addition key set _i

That's hardly grounds for saying that the value of the secret &quot;will
slowly leak&quot;. You have given no reason to believe that this information
will be of any practical value to Eve.

After all, exactly the same observation might be made about a digital
signature, that each signature gives additional information about the
private exponent.  Yet no one would say that issuing signatures causes
your private key to slowly leak, or caution against issuing signatures
because of this consideration!
