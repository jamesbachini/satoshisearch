That's a medallion signature guarantee provided by a bank or similar
institution.  Unlike a notary, the guarantee means something, with
the institution accepting liability for forgery.

Not surprisingly, it's a rare bank bank who will do this for anyone who
isn't already a customer.  At my bank, the same person happens to be a
notary and the guarantee officer and she knows me, so she just asks which
stamp I want.
