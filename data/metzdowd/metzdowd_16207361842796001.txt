Just by curiosity, I ran the Diehard tests on /dev/random (FreeBSD
7.0) and a sha1 sequence of [ 1 ... N ]. Both random files are 63 Mb.
I know that there has been some controversy about /dev/random of
FreeBSD on this list in the past, I don't know if the &quot;issues&quot; has
been solved, though. I do not have any other OS at hand right now.

To interpret the results, quoting DieHard presentation:

        Most of the tests in DIEHARD return a p-value, which
	should be uniform on [0,1) if the input file contains truly
	independent random bits.   Those p-values are obtained by
	p=1-F(X), where F is the assumed distribution of the sample
	random variable X---often normal. But that assumed F is often just
	an asymptotic approximation, for which the fit will be worst
	in the tails. Thus you should not be surprised with  occasion-
	al p-values near 0 or 1, such as .0012 or .9983. When a bit
	stream really FAILS BIG, you will get p`s of 0 or 1 to six
	or more places.  By all means, do not, as a Statistician
	might, think that a p &lt; .025 or p&gt; .975 means that the RNG
	has &quot;failed the test at the .05 level&quot;.  Such p`s happen
	among the hundreds that DIEHARD produces, even with good RNGs.
	 So keep in mind that &quot;p happens&quot;

For /dev/random, I get:

Sum up for Sha1(n):
&quot;Abnormally&quot; high values: 0.938376, 0.927501 [2]
&quot;Abnormally&quot; low values: 0.087107, 0.091750, 0.060212, 0.050921 [4]
Total: 6

So, I would say that Sha1(n) does not pass DieHard (while /dev/random
does). But this would require further examination, in particular to
understand why some tests failed. And, in fact, I have no clue why
they failed...
