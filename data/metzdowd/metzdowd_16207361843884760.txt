</I>&gt;<i> %T   &quot;The dotCrime Manifesto: How to Stop Internet Crime&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the preface, the author notes that network and computer crime is a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of people, not of technology.  However, he also notes that
</I>&gt;<i> changes to the network infrastructure, as well as improvements in
</I>&gt;<i> accountability, would assist in reducing user risk on the net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Section one enlarges on the theme that people are more important than
</I>&gt;<i> machines or protocols.  Chapter one looks at the motive for Internet  
</I>&gt;<i> crime
</I>&gt;<i> (money, just like non-computer crime), and repeats the motifs of the
</I>&gt;<i> preface.  The text goes on to list various categories and examples of
</I>&gt;<i> network fraud.  The content of chapter two is very interesting, but  
</I>&gt;<i> it is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to find a central thread.  Overall it appears to be saying that
</I>&gt;<i> computer criminals are not the masterminds implied by media  
</I>&gt;<i> portrayals, but
</I>&gt;<i> that the problem of malfeasance is growing and needs to be seriously
</I>&gt;<i> addressed.  What Hallam-Baker seems to mean by &quot;Learning from  
</I>&gt;<i> Mistakes,&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> chapter three, is that security professionals often rely too much on  
</I>&gt;<i> general
</I>&gt;<i> principles, rather than accepting a functional, if imperfect,  
</I>&gt;<i> solution that
</I>&gt;<i> reduces the severity of the problem.  Chapter four presents the  
</I>&gt;<i> standard (if
</I>&gt;<i> you'll pardon the expression) discussion of change and the  
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance of new
</I>&gt;<i> technologies.  A process for driving change designed to improve the  
</I>&gt;<i> Internet
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure is proposed in chapter five.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Section two examines ways to address some of the major network crime  
</I>&gt;<i> risks.
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter six notes the problems with many common means of handling  
</I>&gt;<i> spam.
</I>&gt;<i> SenderID and SPF is promoted in chapter seven (without expanding the  
</I>&gt;<i> acronym
</I>&gt;<i> to Sender Policy Framework anywhere in the book that I could find).
</I>&gt;<i> Phishing, and protection against it, is discussed in chapter eight.   
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> nine is supposed to deal with botnets, but concentrates on trojans and
</I>&gt;<i> firewalls (although I was glad to see a mention of &quot;reverse  
</I>&gt;<i> firewalls,&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> egress scanning, which is too often neglected).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Section three details the security tools of cryptography and trust.   
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> ten outlines some history and concepts of cryptography.  Trust, in  
</I>&gt;<i> chapter
</I>&gt;<i> eleven, is confined to the need for aspects of public key  
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> (PKI).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Section four presents thoughts on accountability.  Secure transport,  
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> chapter twelve, starts with thoughts on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer),  
</I>&gt;<i> and then
</I>&gt;<i> moves to more characteristics of certificates and the Extended  
</I>&gt;<i> Verification
</I>&gt;<i> certificates.  (The promotion of Verisign, infrequent and somewhat  
</I>&gt;<i> amusing
</I>&gt;<i> in the earlier chapters is, by this point in the book, becoming  
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly
</I>&gt;<i> annoying.  The author is also starting to make more subjective  
</I>&gt;<i> assertions,
</I>&gt;<i> such as boosting the trusted computing platform initiative.)  Domain  
</I>&gt;<i> Keys
</I>&gt;<i> Identified Mail (DKIM) is the major technology promoted in support  
</I>&gt;<i> of secure
</I>&gt;<i> messaging, in chapter thirteen.  Chapter fourteen, about secure  
</I>&gt;<i> identity,
</I>&gt;<i> has an analysis of a variety of technologies.  (The recommendations  
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> technologies are supported even less than before, and the work now  
</I>&gt;<i> starts to
</I>&gt;<i> sound rather doctrinaire.)  It may seem rather odd to talk about  
</I>&gt;<i> secure
</I>&gt;<i> names as opposed to identities, but Hallam-Baker is dealing with  
</I>&gt;<i> identifiers
</I>&gt;<i> such as email addresses and domain names in chapter fifteen.  Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> sixteen looks at various considerations in regard to securing  
</I>&gt;<i> networks,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly in terms of authentication.  Random thoughts on operating  
</I>&gt;<i> system,
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, or application security make up chapter seventeen.  The  
</I>&gt;<i> author
</I>&gt;<i> stresses, in chapter eighteen, that the law, used in conjunction with
</I>&gt;<i> security technologies, can help in reducing overall threat levels.   
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter
</I>&gt;<i> nineteen finishes off the text with a proposed outline of action  
</I>&gt;<i> that recaps
</I>&gt;<i> the major points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hallam-Baker uses a dry wit well, and to good effect in the book.  The
</I>&gt;<i> humour supports and reinforces the points being made.  So does his
</I>&gt;<i> extensive and generally reliable knowledge of computer technology and
</I>&gt;<i> history.  In certain areas the author is either less knowledgeable or
</I>&gt;<i> careless in his wording, and, unfortunately, the effect is to lessen
</I>&gt;<i> the reader's confidence in his conclusions.  This is a pity, since
</I>&gt;<i> Hallam-Baker is championing a number of positions that would promote
</I>&gt;<i> much greater safety and security on the Internet.  Overall this work
</I>&gt;<i> is, for the non-specialist, a much-better-than-average introduction to
</I>&gt;<i> the issue of Internet crime and protection, and is also worth serious
</I>&gt;<i> consideration by security professionals for the thought-provoking
</I>&gt;<i> challenges to standard approaches to the problems examined.
