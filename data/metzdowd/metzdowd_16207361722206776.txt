DNS is hierarchical.  Nobody wants the DoD (who are traditionally quite
good at keeping secret data) or any other institution to keep keys at
important positions in the hierarchy.  And nobody wants to be the keep
irreplaceable keys, either, which makes introduction at levels below the
DNS root difficult.

This is not a problem with the browser PKI because it's possible to
replace root certificates with a software update (which can be automated
in many cases).

And as Bill pointed out, it's not possible to use the DNS keys directly.
However, you can bootstrap another key based on data from DNS.  This
even works without DNSSEC.  DKIM does that, for instance.
