I'll oversimplify.  Roughly speaking, a 1024-bit RSA public key is the
product of two 512-bit primes.  According to the Prime Number Theorem,
the number of primes &lt; n is approximately n/log(n).  Actually, what we
need is the number of primes &gt;2^511 and &lt;2^512, but that correction
doesn't make much differences -- work through the math yourself to see
that.  Call the number of such primes P.

Now, we need two such primes.  There are therefore P^2 pairs, more than
2^1000.  The numbers are very much larger for 2048- and 4096-bit keys,
but I'll leave those as an exercise for the reader.
