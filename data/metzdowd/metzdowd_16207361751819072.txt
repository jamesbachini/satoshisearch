Fred Cohen proved in 1984 in his &quot;Computer Viruses, Theory and  
Experiments&quot;[1] that &quot;Program P is a virus&quot; is undecidable. I assume  
that this result can be applied to hardware in the form that &quot;Chip C  
contains malicious gates&quot; is also undecidable. (Caveat: Cohen seems to  
make the fundamental assumption that there is no fundamental  
distinction between code and data, something that need not necessarily  
hold everywhere inside a computer chip.)

Fun,
