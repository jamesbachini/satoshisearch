No. In fact, it is about as far from the truth as I've ever
seen. No real expert would choose to deliberately make a protocol more
complicated.

Complexity makes a protocol hard to analyze, and thus makes it hard to
know if the protocol is secure. The author of the quoted article, one
Dan Brown, clearly does not know how cryptographic protocol experts
analyze a protocol. (I've CCed him on this message to give him a
chance to reply, and I'll forward his replies if they're interesting.)

Indeed, I've often seen people forced to alter a protocol specifically
to make it analyzable -- see, for example, the JFK protocol that was
proposed in the IETF as an IKE replacement, which was formally
verified only after it had been changed specifically to improve the
ability to analyze it.

Complexity also makes secure implementation of a protocol much
harder. Indeed, it often makes it impossible to really know that an
implementation is secure even if it appears to meet the
specification. For example, see the numerous encoder flaws that have
been found over the years in protocols like SNMP specifically because
producing a safe ASN.1 compiler is so hard. For another example, see
the enormous interoperability challenges that people have had with
X.509 certificates, many of which have had security implications,
because the complexity has made proper operation in all instances
extremely difficult to implement.

Complexity also does not make something &quot;harder to break
into&quot;. Indeed, it is usually the complexity of a system that provides
the unintended edge conditions necessary to find a hole. If anything,
simple systems are (usually) harder to find flaws in.

In general, complexity is the enemy of security, and any real security
professional could tell you that. Simple and tractable is always
better than complicated, all things being equal -- certainly NOT
the other way around.

&gt;<i> Since I do not consider myself a cryptography expert, and have
</I>&gt;<i> instinctively preferred simpler - but strong - technical solutions,
</I>&gt;<i> have my instincts been wrong all along?
</I>
Your instincts are not wrong. The details of what is simple yet secure
are, of course, not trivial. You can make things *too* simple. A
Caesar cipher isn't secure, even though it is much simpler than
AES. That said, complexity is never something people deliberately
seek.
