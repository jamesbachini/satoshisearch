</I>No, no one competent would deliberately opt for complexity.  However,
there's a quote I've seen attributed to Einstein to remember:
&quot;Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.&quot;
Sometimes, extra complexity is due to the need to deflect certain
attacks, such as replays and cut-and-paste.  It's quite possible that
the original, simpler design isn't resistant to some threats, either
because the designers weren't aware of them or because they felt that
they weren't credible in their environment.  Without more details than
are in the article (and I don't have the time or energy to read through
those documents), it's hard to say.  I did see one possible red flag in
the article: &quot;the key server verifies the client request, then
encrypts, digitally signs, and escrows the key in a database&quot;.
Escrowed keys are potentially *very* dangerous, but without knowing
just what's being stored and how it's being protected, I can't say more.
