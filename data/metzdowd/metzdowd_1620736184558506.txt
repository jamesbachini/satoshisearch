As a data point, the largest bank in Croatia used to mail customers  
pre-printed TAN lists. Some number of years ago, they switched to (non- 
SecurID) tokens which require a 4-digit PIN to turn on, and then  
provide two functions: a login OTP and a challenge/response system for  
authorizing individual transactions. Your username is simply the  
token's serial number, though it's not clear if these are in fact  
serial.
