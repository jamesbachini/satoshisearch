It is a HUGE win for designing a crypto system to have a really 
fast (and good) HW RNG. Being able to generate 10-20,000 AES keys
per second means that you can engineer things that were impossible
to do otherwise.  You can generate as many keys as you like, throw
away keys after one time use, treat them as ephemeral authentication
keys (say give a few million or so to a user), etc. Or you could 
hand a sender 10 MBytes (less than a minute to generate), which then
can be used to create billions of keys (say using Ueli Maurer's 
Bounded Storage Model).  The sender could then use each key to 
uniquely encrypt (AES CTR) each message of a series of messages or
packets to a receiver (AES key setup is fast). No need for an IV or 
worrying about message ordering (each one has a key id), or even the
compromise of a key or two.

Randomness is the most fundamental underpinning of a crypto system
and having lots of it on demand is really fabulous to have in our 
system security design tool box.
