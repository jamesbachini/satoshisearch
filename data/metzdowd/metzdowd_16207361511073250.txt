An interview with DIRNSA, a bit on the subject of cryptomod:

They're purportedly talking about reconfigurable crypto to be able to
run different algorithms:

Xilinx, NSA Create Virtex-4 FPGA-based Cryptographic Solution

FPGA-BASED SINGLE CHIP CRYPTOGRAPHIC SOLUTION (U)

I ran into something talking about a next generation secure identification
friend or foe (SIFF), that if I recall correctly was saying that it was KI-1
backward compatible, sounded reconfigurable.  I know there are other single
chip implementations of older Type I originally using permuters.

You can see that the cryptomod has been underway for a while.

Saw something last week saying the KG-30 family was retired.

There appears to be either two or three cryptoprocessors, too.

Literally everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.
