Peter cites an important difference. You may be able to see but you can't tell.

However, one can still easily reverse-engineer to find the vulnerability
and then present an exploit saying &quot;There's something we noticed here when
the code is executed with this input...&quot;.

The conclusion holds that closed-source is now less of a reasonable argument
in terms of /protecting/ source code.

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), though, would still work in terms of
protecting source code, though, as all you have is a &quot;service oracle&quot; that
does not necessarily reveal code details or flaws. SaaS could be supplied
remotely or locally, with a secure processor card or secure USB-processor.
