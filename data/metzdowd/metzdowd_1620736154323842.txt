hear hear!

I think in the zeal for criticism of the IronDrive, folks have
expanded the definition of Snake Oil to include &quot;All&quot; security
products.

I don't like the &quot;Military Grade AES Encryption&quot; phrase that IronDrive
uses on their website, cause that implies they know what Military is
using. Maybe somebody should notify DoD that these IronDrive folks
know what Military uses to encrypt info ;-)

But other then that I don't see any Snake Oil Crypto like
techno-babble used by IronDrive Marketing.
