Exactly right. After Storm, I don't think anyone reasonable still  
believes that there's no talent in the black hat community. So even if  
this particular piece of malware has implementation issues, the next  
version won't. And then what?

Focusing on the crypto is just missing the point entirely, although I  
suppose it grabs headlines. But the problem at hand has nothing to do  
with crypto, and  everything to do with the fact that our desktop  
security systems are fundamentally broken[0]. There is _no_ _reason_  
that a piece of malware executing silently in the background should  
have access to the user's files without interaction or approval from  
the user. And you can't maliciously encrypt files you can't access.

We know how to build systems that are both drastically more secure and  
more usable than the ones in use today[1]. I wonder if a proliferation  
of headline-grabbing threats like cryptographic ransomware will help  
overcome the OS vendor inertia.
