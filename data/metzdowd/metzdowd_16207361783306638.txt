Upstream authors can take defensive measures against ill-advised
patches of this sort. For a while, distributions were in the habit
of Patching the code that Postfix uses to learn the its own hostname.
Invariably, they botched it. The code now reads:

  /* get_hostname - look up my host name */

  const char *get_hostname(void)
  {
    char    namebuf[MAXHOSTNAMELEN + 1];

    /*
     * The gethostname() call is not (or not yet) in ANSI or POSIX, but it is
     * part of the socket interface library. We avoid the more politically-
     * correct uname() routine because that has no portable way of dealing
     * with long (FQDN) hostnames.
     *
     * DO NOT CALL GETHOSTBYNAME FROM THIS FUNCTION. IT BREAKS MAILDIR DELIVERY
     * AND OTHER THINGS WHEN THE MACHINE NAME IS NOT FOUND IN /ETC/HOSTS OR
     * CAUSES PROCESSES TO HANG WHEN THE NETWORK IS DISCONNECTED.
     *
     * POSTFIX NO LONGER NEEDS A FULLY QUALIFIED HOSTNAME. INSTEAD POSTFIX WILL
     * USE A DEFAULT DOMAIN NAME &quot;LOCALDOMAIN&quot;.
     */
    if (my_host_name == 0) {
      /* DO NOT CALL GETHOSTBYNAME FROM THIS FUNCTION */
      if (gethostname(namebuf, sizeof(namebuf)) &lt; 0)
	msg_fatal(&quot;gethostname: %m&quot;);
      namebuf[MAXHOSTNAMELEN] = 0;
      /* DO NOT CALL GETHOSTBYNAME FROM THIS FUNCTION */
      if (valid_hostname(namebuf, DO_GRIPE) == 0)
	msg_fatal(&quot;unable to use my own hostname&quot;);
      /* DO NOT CALL GETHOSTBYNAME FROM THIS FUNCTION */
      my_host_name = mystrdup(namebuf);
    }
    return (my_host_name);
  }

The addition of &quot;/* DO NOT CALL GETHOSTBYNAME FROM THIS FUNCTION */&quot;
every couple of lines appears to have solved the problem: it deliberately
breaks all prior patches (context diff overlaps), and strongly signals
that the code must not be messed with.
