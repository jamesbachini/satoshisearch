&gt;<i> [1] Show of hands, how many people here not directly involved with X.509 work
</I>&gt;<i>     knew that the spec required that all extensions in CA root certificates
</I>&gt;<i>     (&quot;trust anchors&quot; in recent X.509 jargon) be ignored by an implementation?
</I>&gt;<i>     So if you put in name constraints, key usage constraints, a policy
</I>&gt;<i>     identifier, etc, then a conforming implementation is supposed to look at
</I>&gt;<i>     them, throw them away, and proceed as if they weren't there?
</I>
Are you sure that the constraints are not supposed to be applied when
the root certificate is actually processed, after its signature has been
verified by the trust anchor?
