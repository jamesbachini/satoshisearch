I wouldn't say algebraic geometry is such a pure and abstract specialty 
in this context. It has its roots firmly planted in multivariate 
polynomial algebra, and even at that time it was quite clearly the field 
that was most intimately connected with mechanistic solutions to groups 
of nonlinear polynomial equations over finite fields. Which then is 
exactly what a mathematician sees when presented with a symmetric 
cryptosystem to break. As evidence of that, Hilbert's basis theorem 
(which underlies Groebner bases, which in case relinearization and the 
bunch are an independently discovered special case of) was well known 
and appreciated at that time.

So, even if elliptic curve cryptography became later, the broader theory 
of algebraic geometry was *certainly* relevant to crypto even then, and 
should have easily been seen to be so.

Quite so. I think this is where one should be seeking for the signs of 
differential advantage. Not the broad fields of mathematical expertise 
which plausibly could have been acquired by the NSA for any of a number 
of reasons.

Band agnostic, keying rate adaptable and error tolerant algorithms in 
this department most likely fall in the advanced category even today, 
especially if computationally thrifty. I've certainly never seen 
anything of the sort in what DSP literature I'm aware of.
