Nothing, but you missed my point.  I'm not interested in the DRM functionality, or user-removability.  My point was to look
beyond that original remit.

Specifically, a module which supports authenticated physical removal (with a programmed tamper response) *is* useful, especially
for server applications. (*)  Smartcards and &quot;secure&quot; USB devices might be useful for other applications, but not the one I was
describing, because they lack a tamper response.

Note I'm also saying &quot;programmable tamper response&quot;.  Although I like the idea of wiping keys on tamper response, it's not
necessarily the ideal response.  A better possibility (in certain circumstances) is the device entering a &quot;lockdown&quot; mode with
selected and modelled reduced functionality.  Examples of such circumstances are where the tamper might be triggerable
maliciously, thus facilitating a DoS attack against the service. 

Ian.

(*) And isn't it interesting how so many &quot;desktop&quot; systems are now starting to run application mixes which really look like
servers?
