<PRE>* Saqib Ali:

&gt;<i> can anyone please shed more light on this patent. It seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> patent on the simple process of cryptographic erase......
</I>
Exactly.  Niels Provos, &quot;Encrypting Virtual Memory&quot;, USENIX Security
2000, looks like something pretty close to prior art:

|<i> We investigate several alternative solutions to prevent confidential
</I>|<i> data from remaining on backing store, e.g. erasing data physically
</I>|<i> from the backing store after pages on it become unreferenced.
</I>|<i> However, we find that encryption of data on the backing store with
</I>|<i> volatile random keys has several advantages over other approaches:
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> * The content of a page disappears when its respective encryption key
</I>|<i>   is deleted, a very fast operation. [...]
</I>
AFAICS, the patent does not reference the paper.
