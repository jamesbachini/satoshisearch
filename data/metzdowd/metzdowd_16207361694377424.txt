<PRE>I forwarded a couple of messages about US Customs seizing computers, 
sometimes failing to return them, and demanding passwords. Cellphones 
are also sometimes seized. The TSA claims it does not do this. This 
can cause problems for people who travel with company-sensitive or 
other private information. Some companies avoid the problem by wiping 
all data from the laptop and having the user access it by SSL or 
other secure method over the network. Other solutions are possible.

The following may be a solution for individual travelers without 
access to high-speed internet connections when in the field, or who 
lack access to secure connections to a secure server.

Dave,

Check this as the perfect technological answer to the problem presented below.

Given my position , however, please do not use my name or my 
company's name if you post this.  Like anything, it has as many 
legitimate as illegitimate uses; this is public information and, 
ironically, was brought to my attention by some of the top security 
experts in the industry.

Creates a virtual drive inside of any object of your choosing.  But 
goes one better.  You can encrypt within the encryption in ways 
undetectable.  Thus you can give a password and allow others to open 
it and inspect.  Those looking will never know that within the 
encrypted space there is another deeper form of encryption.  That 
said, I'd really hate to see the gov't or someone else shut this 
down.  At the same time, for people traveling who are doing 
legitimate things that overreaching gov't officials have no right to 
see (and for which it is too late once compromise), this presents a 
valid solution.  It is also incredibly useful for anyone carrying 
sensitive information b/c it gives you two layers of protection if 
your storage device or laptop is stolen.  Know that if you mount it 
to a flash drive, it formats the entire drive.  Most people create an 
object and mount it to that.  Also, never, ever forget your password 
- did that once - and lost 50 megs worth of data.  (might want to use 
roboform, which encrypts and protetcts your passwords).  There's no 
getting inside of this. Ever.  It's about as rock solid as it gets.

Thanks,
