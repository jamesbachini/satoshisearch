The Cryptophone project in Europe &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cryptophone.de/">http://www.cryptophone.de/</A>&gt; has  
been trying to tackle the QoS issues for four or five years now.  I  
haven't looked at their implementation closely in several years, but  
back in 2002 or so they were using CSD (modem-modem calls) instead of  
the broadband channel, trading bandwidth for low jitter...  With  
current CPUs and audio codecs you can get decent voice quality over  
9600bps.

Thanks,
Eric
