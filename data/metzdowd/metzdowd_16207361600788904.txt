<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm looking for a halfway self-contained set of ITU-T recommendations
</I>&gt;<i> which are relevant for implementing X.509v3 certificates.  The
</I>&gt;<i> references in RFC 3280 appear to be incomplete; for instance, a
</I>&gt;<i> reference for ASN.1 itself is missing.
</I>
The ITU/ISO ASN1 standards are available for free download; see 
<A HREF="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/standards/">http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/standards/</A>

&gt;<i> Or is it unreasonable to expect that the specs match what is actually
</I>&gt;<i> needed for interoperability with existing implementations (mostly in the
</I>&gt;<i> TLS, S/MIME area)?
</I>
It's no worse than any other spec-vs-reality.  You're more likely to find 
issues with the IETF specs layered on top of ASN1 than with ASN1 itself.
