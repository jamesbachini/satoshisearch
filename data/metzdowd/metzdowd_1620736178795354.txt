Hi list,

Interesting. Great work! I had been looking *generic* predicate
encryption for some time. Encryption over specific predicates is much
older. Malware (e.g., virus) and software protection schemes have been
using some sort of &quot;predicate encryption&quot; or &quot;trigger&quot; for over two
decades in order to obfuscate code. For example, an old virus used to
scan hard drives looking for a BBS configuration files in a similar
manner and some software protection schemes have encrypted pieces of
code that are decrypted only if some integrity checks (predicates) over
other pieces of the program are passed.

Triggers/predicates are very promising. Yet, they are only useful in
certain applications, since eavesdropping one decryption is enough to
recover the keys and plaintext.

I co-authored a paper were we used this same concept in a software
protection application ([1]) and later we formalized this concept, that
we called secure triggers, in a paper eventually publised at TISSEC
([2]). We were only able to construct triggers for very specific
predicate families, e.g.,
  - p(x)=1 iff x=I for some I in {0,1}^k
  - q(x,y,z,...)=1 iff x=I_1, y=I_2, z=I_3,...; and finally
  - r(x)=1 iff x_{j_1}=b_1,...,x_{j_k}=b_k for some b_1,...,b_k in {0,1}
    and indexes i_1,...,i_k (|x|&gt;=k).
While these predicates do not cover arbitrary large possibilities, they
are implemented by efficient algorithms and require assuming only the
existence of IND-CPA secure symmetric ciphers. In [2] we came up with
more applications other than sofprot;)

</I>&gt;<i> Abstract: Predicate encryption is a new paradigm generalizing, among
</I>&gt;<i> other things, identity-based encryption. In a predicate encryption
</I>&gt;<i> scheme, secret keys correspond to predicates and ciphertexts are
</I>&gt;<i> associated with attributes; the secret key SK_f corresponding to the
</I>&gt;<i> predicate f can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with
</I>&gt;<i> attribute I if and only if f(I)=1. Constructions of such schemes are
</I>&gt;<i> currently known for relatively few classes of predicates.
</I>&gt;<i> We construct such a scheme for predicates corresponding to the
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation of inner products over N (for some large integer N). This, in
</I>&gt;<i> turn, enables constructions in which predicates correspond to the
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation of disjunctions, polynomials, CNF/DNF formulae, or threshold
</I>&gt;<i> predicates (among others). Besides serving as what we feel is a
</I>&gt;<i> significant step forward in the theory of predicate encryption, our
</I>&gt;<i> results lead to a number of applications that are interesting in their
</I>&gt;<i> own right.
