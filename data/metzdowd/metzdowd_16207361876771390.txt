As the discussion so far indicates, and as published papers show, the
security of these &quot;security questions&quot; is lower than the security of
the password.

Can you reference it please?  There has been some analysis on the

The difference is that when you are interfacing with a human, you have 
to go through a low-speed interface, namely, voice. In that respect,
a security question, coupled with a challenge about recent transactions,
makes for adequate security.  The on-line version of the security 
question is vulnerable to automated dictionary attacks.
