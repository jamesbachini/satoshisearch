In draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework, the detailed scheme uses 
self-signed certificates created by client end-entities themselves. The 
basic idea is identical. At the detailed level in my document, the 
client end-entity &quot;auto-issues&quot; a security certificate with a &quot;breached&quot; 
CA private key.

In the TLS Certificate request message, a list of CA distinguished names 
is provided to the end entity. Referring to a &quot;breached&quot; CA public key 
is an invitation to submit a meaningless end-entity certificate, making 
the detailed scheme &quot;more plain&quot; with respect to TLS options (i.e. an 
empty list in a certificate request message could be a not so well 
supported mode in TLS software implementations).

So, maybe the reference to the notion of self-signed EE certificates in 
draft-ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework could be replaced by &quot;meaningless EE 
certificates&quot; (or something else), which would include both self-signed 
or auto-issued. In such a case, the RFC publication for my document 
would become more pressing.

A related discussion occurred on the IETK PKIX mailing list in June 2008 
under the subject &quot;RFC 5280 Question&quot;.
