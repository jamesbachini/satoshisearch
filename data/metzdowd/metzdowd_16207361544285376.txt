I agree that this is minutia, but there is a difference.  If 
the peer can arrange the key to be some predictable secret, 
it can do so without revealing itself.  Eve is happy.  If 
however it has to leak the key some other way, it needs some 
covert channel.  This channel is the sort of thing that 
security reviews might more easily stumble over.  E.g., IDS 
guy asking why these strange packets emanate from the crypto 
server...

Which is to say, it's worth closing off this particular form 
of attack if it can be done without undue cost.  When I did 
a key exchange last in a protocol design, I attempted to 
address it by inserting some hashing steps.
