<PRE>Hi,

This may be out of the remit of the list, if so a pointer to a more
appropriate forum would be welcome.

In Applied Crypto, the use of padding for CBC encryption is suggested
to be met by ending the data block with a 1 and then all 0s to the end
of the block size.

Is this not introducing a risk as you are essentially introducing a
large amount of guessable plaintext into the ciphertext.

Is it not wiser to use RNG data as the padding, and using some kind of
embedded packet size header to tell the system what is padding?

Thanks for your suggestions,

Mr Pink
