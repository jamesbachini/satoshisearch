<PRE>Slashdot this morning has a posting about the possibility of a back door
in the elliptic curve random number generator in FIPS SP 800-90.

<A HREF="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/15/184204">http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/11/15/184204</A> has links to an
article by Bruce Schneier at wired.com, the standard, and the presentation
with the new result.

The work is by Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson and was presented at the
Crypto 2007 rump session. Basically there are two elliptic curve points,
and if you know the discrete logarithm of one relative to the other,
you can reverse engineer the internal state just from the RNG outputs.
It's a very nice piece of analysis.

The problem is that NIST publishes a pair of points that they suggest you
use, in Appendix A.1, without giving any hint of how they were derived.
This leaves open the possibility that they were selected in such a way
as to exploit the Shumow/Ferguson back door.

Now, here's the strange thing. In Appendix A.2 NIST says that you can use
your own pair of points if you want to. But, they caution very strongly
that in that case, anyone relying on the PRNG should verify that the pair
of points were generated randomly. They describe a specific procedure for
generating random points in a provable way (via hashing some other data)
and require that the seeds that were used be saved and made available
to the verifier.

They don't say anything about why this is important, but the work by
Shumow and Ferguson now makes it clear. Otherwise there is the possibility
of a very serious back door.

So this raises the obvious question, why didn't NIST publish the seeds
that were used to generate the default points from Appendix A.1? It
seems odd that they are so insistent about using a verifiable procedure
to create points, and then they don't say whether they followed it
themselves.

If they did use that procedure, NIST could simply publish the seeds for
the point generation and everyone will be able to verify that the points
are random and there is no back door.

Unfortunately there is a complication, which is that one of the pair of
points is inherited from FIPS 186-3, the Digital Signature Standard. The
EC PRNG uses the curve and base point from EC DSS. It then chooses another
point, and the two points are used for the PRNG. It's not particularly
likely that the base point from EC DSS was generated via the randomizing
technique prescribed for the EC RNG. And even if the 2nd point for the
EC RNG is in fact generated randomly and they can prove it, it would not
rule out the possibility that the base point from EC DSS had actually
been pre-selected to allow for a back door. It is crucial that both
points be generated randomly for the EC RNG to be secure.

Ironically, the EC DSS standard does publish a seed used for a
PRNG to generate the elliptic curves, so as to assure that they are
random. However based on my reading of IEEE P1363 which tells how to do
this, it does not appear that the seed constrains the base point, only
the curve parameters. Unless NIST did use a verifiably random method to
generate the base points in EC DSS and the 2nd points in EC PRNG then
there is no foundation for security.

Therefore the only reasonable way forward is for NIST to either publish
the seeds that were used for these points, if they exist, or to revise
the standard to use new points and publish the seeds for both of them.
There is no need to re-use the points from FIPS 186-3, a new pair of
points should be chosen for the PRNG via the specified randomization.
