Halfway, I think.  ISTR there are laws against manufacture for sale,
sale, purchase, or most usage of such gear - but no laws against
manufacture without intent to sell, posession, or some exempted
types of use of such gear.

Basically, owning such devices is not a crime, nor is using them
provided the &quot;target&quot; has been duly notified that their call will be
or is being intercepted.  So you can build the gear, and you can demo
the gear you've built on a call made for purposes of demo-ing the
gear.

Consult a lawyer first, but I believe it may also be legal to monitor
calls made in a given location provided you first put up a sign that
says &quot;all cell calls made on these premises will be monitored&quot; etc.
But you can't legally buy or sell the equipment to do it.

The technical requirement was for a TV with a UHF analog *tuner* as
opposed to a digital channel-selection dial.  The channels that the
cellular network used (still uses?  I don't know) were inbetween the
channels that were assigned whole numbers in TV tuning.  So you could
pick up some cell traffic if you tuned, for example, to UHF TV
&quot;channel&quot; 78.44.  But not if you tuned to channel 78 or channel 79.
