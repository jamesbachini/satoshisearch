Excerpt:

    An internal investigation into billions of euros of losses at
    Societe Generale has found that controls at the French bank
    &quot;lacked depth&quot;.

    The results of the investigation also show that rogue trades
    were first made back in 2005.

Excerpt:

    Societe Generale made a profit in 2007 despite a trading scandal  
that
    cost the bank 4.9bn euros ($7bn; &#163;3.7bn).

    The French bank said it made a net profit of 947m euros for the  
year,
    although this was down 82% from 2006.

I think these two things are very interesting from a viewpoint of  
security and economics. This fellow had been making unauthorized  
trades for two to three years, and when it all came tumbling down, it  
knocked off at most 82% of one year's profits. (I say at most because  
it's reasonable to think that in a year of subprime issues, they'd  
have been down 30-50%.)

Compare and contrast with Nick Leeson's sinking of Baring's, which was  
a mere $1.4bn. We can even double-ish that to say $3bn to account for  
the intervening time.

Both cases were unauthorized trades spinning out of control in  
attempts to cover small losses, but Baring's was sunk for the  
(adjusted) $3bn and SocGen merely loses 80% of one year's profits at  
$5bn.

Does this suggest that what is really needed is a way to detect losses  
that could spin out of control before they do, as opposed to direct  
security mechanisms?
