<PRE>I often say, &quot;Rub a pair of cryptographers together, and you'll

However, he's talking about security, which often isn't quantifiable!

And don't get me ranting about &quot;provable&quot; security....  Had a small
disagreement with somebody at Google the other week, as he complained
that variable moduli ruined the security proof (attempts) for SSH.
