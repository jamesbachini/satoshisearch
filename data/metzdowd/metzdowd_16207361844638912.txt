For some reason, Microsoft's anti-spam filter at microsoft.com is
rejecting a large fraction of the list's traffic as spam. I've looked
at the messages in question carefully and can't for the life of me
figure out why. We're not getting bounced regularly anywhere else.

If you're at Microsoft and missing some fraction of list traffic, now
you know why.
