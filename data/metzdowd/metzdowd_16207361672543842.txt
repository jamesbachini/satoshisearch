some chance they are doing this to save money on transactions that aren't
likely to be approved ... i.e. rather than be charged for a transaction that
they send thru to the issuer that they are sure to be rejected ... they
reject it upfront.

now the associations have standard procedure to perform &quot;stand-in&quot; when
the network accepts a transaction from an acquirer but isn't able to forward
it to the issuer. stand-in allows the network to decide whether to approve
or reject the transaction using simplified rules. later, when contact is
re-established with the issuer ... the issuer has to be informed of all
the stand-in activity.

a possible simplified mechanism is to be able to generate a simulated 
stand-in
report of rejected transactions. the issue then in such a simulated stand-in
role ... for all the reasons that they chose to reject a transaction ... 
do they map
into the standard iso 8583 codes for reasons that the issuer would reject
the transaction.
