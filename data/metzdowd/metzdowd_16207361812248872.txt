	3. The server that stores your mail is not the first one to
	receive it. It is just the storage layer. A previous non-storing
	server, encrypts the mail and *then* forwards it to the store.

    S/MIME does not encrypt any headers. It only encrypts the
    payload. Some S/MIME applications don't leave any useful
    headers in the outer message, others leave the sender and
    subject in the clear.

Take PGP Universal gateway and turn-it inside-out. Clear mail on the
Internal encrypted mail on the intranet between the gateway and the
mail store.

Take a vanity domain, run an encryption gateway, forward everything to to
an ESP. The ESP's search engine will not do you much good with encrypted
mail, so indexing is up to your IMAP client, if it can cache/index
decrypted content.

Not much demand for this yet, so I don't expect mature offerings any
time soon. We'd have to build a boutique service for cipher-punks.
