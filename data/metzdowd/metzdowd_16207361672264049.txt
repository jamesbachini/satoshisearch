&gt;&gt;<i>From the BBC:

</I>&gt;<i>   TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson has lost money after publishing his bank
</I>&gt;<i>   details in his newspaper column.

Has anybody read the original column/editorial/whatever in the Sunday
Times and can tell whether Mr Clarkson has, in fact, claimed that he
actually lost money?

The secondary reporting is very unclear on this point.
