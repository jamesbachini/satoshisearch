I have been considering the problem of encrypted channels over UDP or 
IP.  TLS will not work for this, since it assumes and provides a 
reliable, and therefore non timely channel, whereas what one wishes to 
provide is a channel where timeliness may be required at the expense of 
reliability.

I have figured out a solution, which I may post here if you are interested.
