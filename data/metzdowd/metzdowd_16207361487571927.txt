<PRE>It's an interesting question for sure.

I can't help but think that if the hardware platforms were to open up, and
the handsets obtain some sort of ubiquity that this sort of thing would
spontaneously evolve.

I saw this link today:
<A HREF="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2007/07/openmokocom_goes_live_get_your.html">http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2007/07/openmokocom_goes_live_get_your.html</A>
And apart from the fact that I was just plain out impressed that it has 2 3d
accelerometers, I thought it was only a matter of time before someone
inserts a cryptographic layer between the voice and the transmission.

Cheers,

Chris

That's interesting -- the news just came out about Blackberry entering
the Chinese market...  See

such issues.
