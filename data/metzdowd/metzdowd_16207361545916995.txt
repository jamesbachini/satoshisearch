This attack may not be as practical as an algebraic attack would be,  
but it shows that SecurID keyed hash function is in fact weaker than  
what its claimed 64-bit security level demands. AFAIK, algebraic  
cryptanalysis of the RSA SecurID keyed hash function by the academic  
sector hasn't even been performed yet. Their new tokens use AES-128.  
Maybe they do learn after all...
