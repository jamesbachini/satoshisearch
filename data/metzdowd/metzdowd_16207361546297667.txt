There have been a number of half-years that <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">Seti at Home</A> was faster than
the top machines in the top500 list (counting by bogomips, not real LINPAK),
and most of the times I've checked, it's been at least in the top 10.

Some of the stats can be found at top500.org and
<A HREF="http://boinc.netsoft-online.com/e107_plugins/boinc/bp_summary.php">http://boinc.netsoft-online.com/e107_plugins/boinc/bp_summary.php</A>
(though good <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">SETI at Home</A> stats have been harder to get in recent years,
partly for organizational or presentational reasons,
and partly because it's spun off a bunch of other mass-computing programs.)
