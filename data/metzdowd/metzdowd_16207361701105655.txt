With the big browser war still going strong, wouldn't that provide 
fantastic marketing opportunities for Firefox?

If Firefox would support these secure password protocols, and the banks 
would openly recommend their customers to use Firefox because its safer 
and protects them better from phishing, that would be great publicity 
for Firefox, draw more users, and force M$ to support it too in the long 
run...

...these protocol would even make the use of one-time-passwords more 
secure (no MITM exposure - phishing), and make them securely usable 
without any server-certs...

I was afraid that this cynical argument would play a role... so the 
server-cert racketeering scheme has just been made more profitable 
through more expensive but equally &quot;trustworthy&quot; EV-certs, which makes 
it more difficult to introduce alternatives that don't fit into this 
&quot;business model&quot;...

On the other hand, I'm sure that the marketeers will be able to sell 
server-certs together with those secure passwords protocols to the naive 
customers as it will be very difficult to explain why you do/don't need 
the certs and why it would more/less secure...
