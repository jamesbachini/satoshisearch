Good stuff.

I was hoping perhaps to stimulate a discussion on just these sorts of issues.

There's a bit of interrelated stuff here; you can start with requirements,
postulate some mechanisms, think about implications of their implementation,
which leads to refining requirements.  It's sure to be a learning experience.

Maybe this isn't the best place to do that, but it seems to me that this group
would be one of the best for ironing out the details, and would have a vested
interest in any such management interface not suck.

Ideally I'd like to be able to develop something for, say, Linux, and possibly
integrate it with your open-source co-processor stuff.

Sure.

Maybe that's a good question: what are the idioms in key management?

Is there any similar work already that I could read up on?

Where can I read up on current HSM functionality, offerings, features, etc.?
