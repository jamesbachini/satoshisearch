<PRE>&gt;<i>I do not believe the mentioned conflict exists.  The aim of these
</I>&gt;<i>calculator-like devices is to make sure that no malware, virus etc can
</I>&gt;<i>create unauthorized transactions.  The user should still be able to
</I>&gt;<i>debug, and inspect the software in the calculator-like device, or
</I>&gt;<i>virtual software compartment, just that installation of software or
</I>&gt;<i>upgrades into that area should be under direct explicit user control.

In view of the number of people who look at an email message, click on
an attached ZIP file, rekey a file password in the message, and then
run the program in the file, thereby manually installing a virus, it's
way too dangerous to let users install any code at all on a security
device.

PS: Yes, they really do.  I didn't believe it either.
