<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/washington/18nuke.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/washington/18nuke.html</A> -- it notdes
that &quot;The system hinges on what is essentially a switch in the firing
circuit that requires the would-be user to enter a numeric code that
starts a timer for the weapon?s arming and detonation.&quot;  I don't think
that that's quite correct -- it permits arming; PALs are not in the
firing circuit, I believe -- but this section is more interesting:
&quot;Delicate design details involve how to bury the link deep inside a
weapon to keep terrorists or enemies from disabling the safeguard.&quot;
In other words, it's easy to have a circuit that keeps the bomb from
arming; the hard part is doing so with high assurance against attacks,
and that's very design-dependent.
