<PRE>	i'm an OpenBSD developer, so i have some knowlege but could be biased.

&gt;<i> SSH (OpenSSH) is routinely used in secure access for remote server
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance. However, as I see it, SSH has a number of security issues
</I>&gt;<i> that have not been addressed (as far I know), which create unnecessary
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some issues could be minimized by turning off password authentication,
</I>&gt;<i> which is not practical in many cases. Other issues can be addressed by
</I>&gt;<i> additional means, for example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. firewall port-knocking to block scanning and attacks
</I>&gt;<i> 2. firewall logging and IP disabling for repeated attacks (prevent DoS,
</I>&gt;<i> block dictionary attacks)
</I>
	i guess it can be handled in lines of spamd (greylisting) on OpenBSD.

&gt;<i> 3. pre- and post-filtering to prevent SSH from advertising itself and
</I>&gt;<i> server OS
</I>
	is there any point in this as you can fingerprint OS both actively (nmap)
	and passively (p0f)?

&gt;<i> 4. block empty authentication requests
</I>&gt;<i> 5. block sending host key fingerprint for invalid or no username
</I>&gt;<i> 6. drop SSH reply (send no response) for invalid or no username
</I>
	i can understand your desire, but this is a feature used by some of the
	anonymous services such as anonymous CVS.  i'd leave it to openssh
	developers.
