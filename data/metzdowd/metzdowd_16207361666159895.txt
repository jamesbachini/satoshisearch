An Islamist website often used by al Qaeda supporters is promoting
encryption software which it says will help Islamic militants communicate
with greater security on the internet.

The Mujahideen Secrets 2 software was promoted as &quot;the first Islamic program
for secure communications through networks with the highest technical level
of encoding&quot;.

The software, available free on the password-protected Ekhlaas.org site
which often carries al Qaeda messages, is a newer version of Mujahideen
Secrets issued in early 2007 by the Global Islamic Media Front, an al
Qaeda-linked web-based group.

&quot;This special edition of the software was developed and issued by ...
Ekhlaas in order to support the mujahideen (holy war fighters) in general
and the (al Qaeda-linked group) Islamic State in Iraq in particular,&quot; the
site said.

On the other hand, imagine if the software were compromised by a TLA in the
spirit of the recent revival of interest of Crypto AG?  What a coup that
would be.  Of course vulnerabilities can be simply a matter of using the
wrong random number generator...
