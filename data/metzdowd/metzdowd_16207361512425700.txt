Or as the New Zealand Herald put it:

Windows blamed for Skype crash - 21 Aug 2007 - NZ Herald: Technology News
from New Zealand and around the World

<A HREF="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10458978">http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10458978</A>

&quot;Skype has now identified and already introduced a number of improvements to
its software to ensure that our users will not be similarly affected in the
unlikely possibility of this combination of events recurring,&quot; said the blog.

If the unlike event is referring to Windows users automatic updates, I
wouldn't bet on it.
