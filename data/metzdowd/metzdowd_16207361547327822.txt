AES can be permitted for use in classified environments. See

While I don't understand this quibble about standard terminology, I do
note that the IronKey language is somewhat misleading. There are no
FIPS-approved non-deterministic RNGs at this point, as all of the
FIPS-approved RNGs are deterministic (pseudo) RNGs. (See
<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexc.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexc.pdf</A>) It
is possible to use a non-deterministic RNG to seed a FIPS-approved PRNG,
but I don't know of anyone in the FIPS 140-2 world that claims doing so
makes the non-deterministic RNG &quot;FIPS 140-2 compliant.&quot; 

(Also, if random data is utilized during key generation within a FIPS
140-2 module, then a FIPS-approved RNG must be utilized to generate that
data in order to meet FIPS 140-2 requirements. Since all the
FIPS-approved RNGs are PRNGs, a true RNG is not going to meet the FIPS
140-2 requirement here.)

Overall, colorful language and FIPS 140 hand-waving seem like the
marketing norm in the &quot;security products that utilize crypto&quot; world. I
think the language used by IronKey falls right in line with that, but I
don't get a sense of snake oil. Then again, I don't really care either.
