Whatever it is it seems to have been garbled beyond recognition, if they were
just looking for straight evidence they'd be using Encase, if they were
looking for data in erase bands (assuming the drive was old enough to still
feature them, they'd be hard to find in any modern drive) they'd be using
something like a magnetic force microscope which is a scanning probe
microscope, or a magnetic force scanning tunneling microscope, and in either
case I doubt you could read perpendicularly-recorded EPRML data just by
staring at it.  So I don't think it's possible to draw any conclusions from
this data.
