Sure. however, if the virus (once infecting the machine) generated a 
random session key, symmetric-encrypted the files, then encrypted the 
session key with the public key as part of the &quot;ransom note&quot; then that 
would allow a single public key to be used to issue multiple ransom 
demands, without the unlocking of any one machine revealing the &quot;master 
key&quot; that could unlock all of them.

giving away your entire extortion capability to the first person to pay 
up doesn't seem sane, if you could as easily make each machine a unique 
proposition...
