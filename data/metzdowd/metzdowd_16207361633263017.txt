<PRE>Hi Folks --

I was wondering to what extent the folks on this list have taken
a look the PunchScan voting scheme:

  <A HREF="http://punchscan.org/">http://punchscan.org/</A>

The site makes the following claims:

&gt;&gt;<i> End-to-end cryptographic independent verification, or E2E, is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  mechanism built into an election that allows voters to take a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> piece of the ballot home with them as a receipt. This receipt 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not allow voters to prove to others how they voted, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  does permit them to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Verify that they have properly indicated their votes to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> election officials (cast-as-intended).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Verify with extremely high assurance that all votes were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counted properly (counted-as-cast).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Voters can check that their vote actually made it to the tally,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and that the election was conducted fairly.
</I>

Those seem at first glance to be a decent set of claims, from
a public-policy point of view.  If somebody would prefer a
different set of claims, please explain.


PunchScan contains some nifty crypto, but IMHO this looks like
a classic case of too much crypto and not enough real security.

I am particularly skeptical of one of the FAQ-answers
 <A HREF="http://punchscan.org/faq-protections.php#5">http://punchscan.org/faq-protections.php#5</A>

Several important steps in the process must be carried out in
secret, and if there is any leakage, there is unbounded potential
for vote-buying and voter coercion.
  The Boss can go to each voter and make the usual silver-or-lead
  proposition:  Vote as I say, and then show me your voting receipt.
  I'll give you ten dollars.  But if I find out you voted against
  me, I'll kill you.

The voter cannot afford to take the chance that even a small
percentage of the ballot-keys leak out.

1) It would be nice to see some serious cryptological protection
of election processes and results.

2a) I don't think we're there yet.

2b) In particular I don't think PunchScan really solves &quot;the&quot;
whole problem.

3) I'd love to be wrong about item (2).  Does anybody see a way
to close the gaps?
