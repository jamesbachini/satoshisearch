Without seeing all of the expense (and likely inability) of securing
and ensuring the proper count from the machine, people look at the
problem and go &quot;computers are good at counting things fast and people
aren't, so it must therefore be massively cheaper to have a computer
do the count&quot;.

If you're &gt;just&lt; talking about summing a few lists, that's true. But
of course, no one who doesn't work for a voting machine company is
just talking about summing a few lists.

The idea that after you factor in everything, it might actually be
cheaper to have people do it after all, is a very difficult one for
many people to even conceptualize. &quot;Progress&quot; demands that computers
do all menial tasks.
