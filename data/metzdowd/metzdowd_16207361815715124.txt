Excerpt:

   Bruce Haggard, an election commissioner in Faulkner County,
   Arkansas, is baffled by a problem that occurred with two voting
   machines in this month's state primary elections. The machines
   allocated votes cast in one race to an entirely different race that
   wasn't even on the electronic ballot. The problem resulted in the
   wrong candidate being declared victor in a state House nomination
   race.
