EKMI TC,

The San Francisco ISACA chapter is pleased to announce the opening of
registration for the &#179;Enterprise Key Management Infrastructure Workshop&quot;
to be held at the Hotel Nikko (222 Mason St., SF) on Thursday, November
15.  This will be a morning session, breakfast followed by the workshop
until noon. We're exploring now the possibility of extending the session
into the afternoon for an optional hands-on exercise.  [This is now
confirmed.  It is optional, and those interested in staying for the lab
session must bring their own laptop to perform the exercise.  The laptop
must have either Windows XP or Linux with at least 512MB of memory and
2GB of free disk space.]

I hope you can attend and encourage your collogues to do the same. More
information can be found at <A HREF="http://sfisaca.org.">http://sfisaca.org.</A>
