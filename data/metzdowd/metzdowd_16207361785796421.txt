Call for Papers

		       EIGHTH ACM DRM WORKSHOP
      (Co-located with ACM-CCS 2008, Alexandria, Virginia, USA)


		   <A HREF="http://www.ece.unm.edu/DRM2008/">http://www.ece.unm.edu/DRM2008/</A>


Submission deadline: May 23, 2008
Workshop: October 27, 2008 - Alexandria, Virginia, USA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ACM Workshop on Digital Rights Management is an international forum
that serves as an interdisplinary bridge between areas that can be
applied to solving the problem of Intellectual Property protection of
digital content.  These include: cryptography, software and computer
systems design, trusted computing, information and signal processing,
intellectual property law, policy-making, as well as business analysis
and economics. Its purpose is to bring together researchers from the
above fields for a full day of formal talks and informal discussions,
covering new results that will spur new investigations regarding the
foundations and practices of DRM.

This year's workshop, the eighth in the series, continues this
tradition. As in the previous editions, it is sponsored by ACM SIGSAC
and is held in conjunction with the ACM Conference in Computer and
Communications Security (CCS).

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* anonymous publishing, privacy and DRM
* architectures for DRM systems
* business models for online content distribution, risk management
* copyright-law issues, including but not limited to fair use
* digital goods and online multiplayer games
* digital policy management
* DRM and consumer rights, labeling and competition law
* implementations and case studies
* information theory and  combinatorics, including marking assumptions
  and related codes
* robust identification of digital content
* security  issues,  including   but  not  limited  to  authorization,
  encryption, tamper resistance, and watermarking
* regulatory authority for DRM, interoperability
* supporting  cryptographic technology  including but  not  limited to
  traitor tracing, broadcast encryption, obfuscation
* threat and vulnerability assessment
* trusted   computing,   attestation,   hardware  support   for   DRM,
  side-channels
* usability aspects of DRM systems
* web services related to DRM systems
