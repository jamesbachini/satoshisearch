To be sure that implementation does not contain back-doors, one needs
not only some source code but also a proof that the source code one
has is the source of the implementation. With open-source software one
can get such a proof by compiling the source themself (as far as they
trust their compiler toolchain), but I don't see any way to get such a
proof for non-FPGA hardware.
