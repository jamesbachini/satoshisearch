They let strong crypto through all the time. I can't imagine what  
*technology* you couldn't get through. Definitely, however, there are  
*people* who couldn't get an export license because they've been bad  
in the past.

So the answer to your questions is that they're vetting who you are  
far more than what you're exporting.
