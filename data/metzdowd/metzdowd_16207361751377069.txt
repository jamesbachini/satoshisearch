I did notice this reference to certificates in the phishing blabla message.

I checked very quickly at comerica.com, they don't seem to use client PK 
pairs (nor certificates), merely the usual name/password authentication.

If the target financial institution was using client authentication, it 
would be interesting to see phishing scenario details, but that's not 
the case until shown otherwise.

I'm not impressed by the phisher blabla message.
