<PRE>That's quite an interesting thing to ponder, but don't forget that only 
some supercomputer applications (like crypto!) can be handled well by this 
sort of highly distributed system.  There is more to most &quot;real 
supercomputers&quot; than just MHz times number of CPUs - there is also very 
high-speed data communications and sharing between those multiple CPUs. 
The botnet does not have that, so it is limited to working on problems 
that can be completely divided into independent pieces of work where there 
is little or no need to pass data between the CPUs.  If you're trying to 
do an exhaustive key search, however, it looks like a pretty attractive 
thing to use.
