Boson. Bosons are force-carrier particles, as opposed to fermions.  
Photons are themselves bosons, but there are other bosons that carry  
other forces. There's the Higgs boson, W and Z bosons, and so on.  
Gluons, the particles that hold atomic nuclei together are also bosons.

Bogons are, technically, bosons as they are the particle that carries  
a quantum unit of bogosity. However, you yourself have criticized  
people who discuss the role of bogosity in quantum cryptography [sic]  
(I prefer the term &quot;quantum secrecy&quot;), and therefore I will say no  
more about bogons and QC.
