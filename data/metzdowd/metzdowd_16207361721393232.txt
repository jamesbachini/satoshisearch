Actually there are already companies doing something like this, but they've
run into a problem that no-one has ever considered so far: The GTCYM needs a
(relatively) high-bandwidth connection to a remote server, and there's no easy
way to do this.

(Hint: You can't use anything involving USB because many corporates lock down
USB ports to prevent data leaking onto other corporates' networks, or
conversely to prevent other corporates' data leaking onto their networks. Same
for Ethernet, Firewire, ...).
