Welcome to the world of public cryptography! :-) At least I haven't 
seen anyone so far suggest that you will find pre-images.

Is there any estimation of how high? Specifically, do you believe 
there is a good chance of having less work effort than the current 
Wang strategy? For example, if you are sure that your result will be 
around 2^70, well that is interesting in theory but probably not 
worth any publicity you have gotten so far. If you are sure it will 
be around 2^55, I'll certainly give you some of my spare CPU cycles.

That's good to hear. It would also be interesting if you could keep a 
running meter of approximately how much work you are getting from the 
participants. This isn't nearly as &quot;sexy&quot; as finding ETs or even 
protein folding...
