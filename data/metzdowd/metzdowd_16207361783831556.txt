<PRE>Hi gang,

In looking at captchas that have been broken via software it 
dawned on me that the amount of &quot;mental processing&quot; involved is 
actually very little. I'm interested in what the current state of 
image recognition via software of things like knowing the 
difference between a monkey and a cat or a child laughing or just 
happy and the degree of reliability of the differentiation. I've 
done a bit of looking around and don't find much. Does anyone 
have knowledge of or a  pointer to someone who might know where 
to look about this?

Thanks,

Allen
