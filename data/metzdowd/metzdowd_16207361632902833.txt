Well, that's the right question.  That's the sort of question
the punchscan team should be asking themselves, and answering
in more detail that I have heretofore seen.  What threats does
punchscan claim to defend against?  What threats does it leave
to be mitigated by other (non-punchscan) means?

As an example: Let's look at the plant where the ballots are
printed.  Suppose somebody attaches a tiny &quot;spy camera&quot; to
the frame of one of the printing presses, so as to obtain an
image of both parts of the two-part ballot (for some subset
of the ballots).

Obviously anybody who gets this information can defeat all the
cryptologic protections that the protocol is supposed to provide
(for that subset of the ballots).

  Note that the spy camera can be hiding in plain sight, in
  the guise of a &quot;security camera&quot;.  Many election-related
  facilities are /required/ to have security cameras.

  There's a difference between mathematical cryptology and real-
  world security.

&gt;<i> There are no per-ballot keys, so there is no partial exposure risk.

It's bad luck to prove things that aren't true.  I just gave an
example of a &quot;partial exposure risk&quot;, since some of the ballots
were seen by the spy camera and some weren't.

&gt;<i> The protocol assumes
</I>&gt;<i> the existence of an Election Authority. 
</I>
Ah yes, but what is being assumed about the /properties/ of
this Election Authority?  Is the EA omnipresent and omnipotent,
like the FSM, or does it have boundaries and limitations?
For example, does it ever need to rely on employees or
subcontractors?
