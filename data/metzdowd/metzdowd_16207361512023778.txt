Subject: [Full-disclosure] Skype Network Remote DoS Exploit

Hi all!

On SecurityLab.ru forum an exploit code was published by an anonymous
user.  Reportedly it must have caused Skype massive disconnections
today.

The PoC uses standard Skype client to call to a specific number.
This call causes denial of service of current Skype server and
forces Skype to reconnect to another server. The new server also
&quot;freezes&quot; and so on ... the entire network.

Liks: <A HREF="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/301422.php">http://www.securitylab.ru/news/301422.php</A>
PoC: <A HREF="http://en.securitylab.ru/poc/301420.php">http://en.securitylab.ru/poc/301420.php</A>

Best regards,
