Tahoe doesn't run this service either. I can't use it to make guesses  
at any of the values you mentioned. I can use it to make guesses at  
whole documents incorporating such values, which is in most cases a  
highly non-trivial distinction.

To make such guesses, I need to account for at least:

- file formats, since an e-mail message has a different on-disk
   representation depending on the recipient's e-mail client,

- temporal and transport variance, as PDF documents generally
   incorporate a generation timestamp, and e-mail messages include
   routing headers (with timestamps!),

- document modifications due to variables other than the one(s) being
   guessed, e.g. names, e-mail addresses, customized unsubscribe links.

I would be interested to see an actual real-world example of how a  
document would fall to this attack. It strikes me as a cute threat in  
theory, but uninteresting in practice.

Sometimes, under highly peculiar circumstances, etc.

FWIW, I have discussed this threat verbally with colleagues when I was  
asked for possible designs for OLPC's server-based automatic backup  
system. I dismissed it at the time as 'not a real-world concern'. I  
might even have it in my notes, but those weren't published, so it's  
moot.

Yeah, sorry, I wasn't being clear. I should've just said &quot;a key  
strengthening function&quot; rather than naming anything in particular.

&gt;<i> This would have a performance impact on normal everyday use of Tahoe

</I>
Adding, say, 5 seconds of computation to the time it takes to store a  
file is likely to be lost as noise in comparison with the actual  
network upload time, while still making an attacker's life  
_dramatically_ harder than now.

&gt;<i> The trade-off is actually worse than it appears since the attacker is

</I>
Again, is there a real-world example of the kind of data or documents  
that would show this to be a serious problem? While it's technically  
true that you're targeting all the users in parallel when brute  
forcing, note that if you're not actually hyper-targeting your attack,  
you need to brute force _all_ the variables I mention above in  
parallel, except in pathological cases -- and those, if you know of  
some, would be interesting for the discussion.

&gt;<i> economy of scale, and can profitably invest in specialized tools,

</I>
The OpenBSD eksblowfish/bcrypt design can't be bitsliced and generally  
doesn't lend itself well to large speedups in hardware, by design.
