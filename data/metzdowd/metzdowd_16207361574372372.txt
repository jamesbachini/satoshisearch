I never understand these long threads about patents.  They always follow
the same course.  I address the following to the whole list, not just you.

Fact: Most patents get granted, even for things you might consider
trivial.  Instead of complaining about it, work for patent reform.  How
about an open review process where the public can submit prior art via
the web?  EU patents face a similar challenge period.  So go help make
this happen!

Fact: Most patents are never used, meaning no lawsuit is filed against
someone based on infringement.  Most are kept in reserve in case the
company is sued for their product infringing something else or for
negotiating leverage in business deals.

Given these two things, it makes little sense to whine about a single
patent on an obscure mailing list.  Instead, go do something about the
process as a whole.
