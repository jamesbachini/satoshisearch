And in those twenty years we have made little progress on the division 
problem with elliptic curves, and considerable progress on the discrete 
log problem on integers.  Surely, with a thousand year start, progress 
on integers should be slowing down, not speeding up.

Further, this is what one would expect from the irregular character of 
elliptic curves.
