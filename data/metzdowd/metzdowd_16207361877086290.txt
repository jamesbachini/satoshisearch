<PRE>One of the earlier messages (I lost it) said that Philipp said that 
there was information that could be used as a nonce. In that case, I 
would recommend a stream cipher used to generate 133 bits at a time; if 
the lump of bits represents an integer in the correct range, add it 
modulo 10^40... otherwise generate more bits. This is about as simple as 
it gets.
