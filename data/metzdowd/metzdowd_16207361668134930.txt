<PRE>A knowledgeable colleague (but who is nevertheless not a crypto expert)
thinks he's seen something about Typex (the WW II British rotor
machine) having been cracked.  Does anyone know anything about that?  A
quick Google found nothing of the sort, but did find references showing
that it was used as late as 1970.
