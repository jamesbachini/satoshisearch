Where do they get their IVs from?

In general, I feel like the only way to really verify that these
things are being done correctly is to be able (in software) to read
the ciphertext and verify that it is encrypted with the right key in
the right mode. The small amount I've heard about the design leads me
to worry that this is not actually possible.
