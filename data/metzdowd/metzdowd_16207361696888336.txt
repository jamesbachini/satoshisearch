It is a bit early. OpenSSL 0.9.9 is not yet released. I wish OpenSSL
releases were more frequent, and each added fewer features, allowing
features to be released as they mature, this would also reduce pressure
to add features to stable releases (which occasionally break binary
compatibility, and lead to vendors back-porting fixes rather than deploying
the next patch level of the stable release).

While Firefox should ideally be developing and testing PSK now, without
stable libraries to use in servers and browsers, we can't yet expect
anything to be released.
