<PRE>www.usable.com has launched a new password management service intended
to make it easy to login to participating web sites.  However, I don't
see any details of the protocols or algorithms.  In particular, I don't
see any mention of whether or not the system even attempts to prevent
people with access to the servers at usable.com from having the ability
to impersonate users of the service.
