Call for Participation

MetriCon 3.0
Third Workshop on Security Metrics
Tuesday, 29 July 2008, San Jose, California
Overview

Security metrics -- an idea whose time has come. No matter whether you 
read the technical or the business press, there is a desire for 
converting security from a world of adjectives to a world of numbers. 
The question is, of course, how exactly to do that. The advantage of 
starting early is, as ever, harder problems but a clearer field though 
it is very nearly too late to start early. MetriCon is where hard 
progress is made and harder problems brought forward.

The MetriCon Workshops offer lively, practical discussion in the area of 
security metrics. It is a, if not the, forum for quantifiable approaches 
and results to problems afflicting information security today, with a 
bias towards practical, specific implementations. Topics and 
presentations will be selected for their potential to stimulate 
discussion in the Workshop. Past events are detailed here [1] and here 
[2]; see, especially, the meeting Digests on those pages.

MetriCon 3.0 will be a one-day event, Tuesday, July 29, 2008, in San 
Jose, California, USA. The Workshop begins first thing in the morning, 
meals are taken in the meeting room, and work/discussion extends into 
the evening. As this is a workshop, attendance is by invitation (and 
limited to 60 participants). Participants are expected to &quot;come with 
findings,&quot; to &quot;come with problems,&quot; or, better still, both. Participants 
should be willing to discuss what they have and need, i.e., to address 
the group in some fashion, formally or not. Preference will naturally be 
given to the authors of position papers/presentations who have actual 
work in progress.

Presenters will each have a short 10-15 minutes to present his or her 
idea, followed by a another 10-15 minutes of discussion. If you would 
like to propose a panel or a group of related presentations on different 
approaches to the same problem, then please do so. Also consistent with 
a Workshop format, the Program Committee will be steered by what sorts 
of proposals come in response to this Call.

Goals and Topics

Our goal is to stimulate discussion of, and thinking about, security 
metrics and to do so in ways that lead to realistic, early results of 
lasting value. Potential attendees are invited to submit position papers 
to be shared with all, with or without discussion on the day of the 
Workshop. Such position papers are expected to address security metrics 
in one of the following categories:

Benchmarking of security technologies
Empirical studies in specific subject matter areas
Financial planning
Long-term trend analysis and forecasts
Metrics definitions that can be operationalized
Security and risk modeling including calibrations
Tools, technologies, tips, and tricks
Visualization methods both for insight and lay audiences
Data and analyses emerging from ongoing metrics efforts
Other novel areas where security metrics may apply
Practical implementations, real world case studies, and detailed models 
will be preferred over broader models or general ideas.

How to Participate

Submit a short position paper or description of work done or ongoing. 
Your submission must be brief -- no longer than five (5) paragraphs or 
presentation slides. Author names and affiliations should appear first 
in or on the submission. Submissions may be in PDF, PowerPoint, HTML, or 
plaintext email and must be submitted to metricon3 AT 
securitymetrics.org. These requests to participate are due no later than 
noon GMT, Monday, May 12, 2008 (a hard deadline).

The Program Committee will invite both attendees and presenters. 
Participants of either sort will be notified of acceptance quickly -- by 
June 2, 2008. Presenters who want hardcopy materials to be distributed 
at the Workshop must provide originals of those materials to the Program 
Committee by July 21, 2008. All slides, position papers, and what-not 
will be made available to all participants at the Workshop. No formal 
academic proceedings are intended, but a digest of the meeting will be 
prepared and distributed to participants and the general public. 
(Digests for previous MetriCon meetings are on the past event pages 
mentioned above.) Plagiarism is dishonest, and the organizers of this 
Workshop will take appropriate action if dishonesty of this sort is 
found. Submission of recent, previously published work as well as 
simultaneous submissions to multiple venues is entirely acceptable, but 
only if you disclose this in your proposal.

Location

MetriCon 3.0 will be co-located with the 17th USENIX Security Symposium 
at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California.

Cost

$225 all-inclusive of meeting space, materials preparation, and meals 
for the day.
