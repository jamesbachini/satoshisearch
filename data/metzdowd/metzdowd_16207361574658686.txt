</I>As others have pointed out, with a large enough salt, dictionary attacks
become impossible.  But it's worth mentioning another issue:  People's
userid's do change and it's nice not to have the hashed passwords break
as a result.  (This is pretty counter-intuitive to users who change their 
names, and a disaster if a large organization needs to do a mass renaming
and somehow has to coordinate a mass password update at the same time.)
