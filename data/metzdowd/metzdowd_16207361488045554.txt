Uh-oh, no.  The protocol characteristics don't change depending on who
is selling you the device.  Many telcos have an aversion to end-to-end
protocols.  Building reliable networks for ill-behaving end systems
has been a pretty recent idea (and we are still far away from a
complete solution).

There aren't any interception requirements for device vendors, either,
at least not any I'm aware of.  They aren't telcos.  Projects like
OpenMoko should not be affected.
