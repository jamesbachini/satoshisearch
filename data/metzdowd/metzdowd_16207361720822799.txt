<PRE> From time to time I hear that DNSSEC is working fine, and on examining 
the matter I find it is &quot;working fine&quot; except that ....

Seems to me that if DNSSEC is actually working fine, I should be able to 
provide an authoritative public key for any domain name I control, and 
should be able to obtain such keys for other domain names, and use such 
keys for any purpose, not just those purposes envisaged in the DNSSEC 
specification.  Can I?  It is not apparent to me that I can.
