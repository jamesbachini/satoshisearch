The portability aspect was one contributing factor, but the other one was more
philosophical.  As Dan Geer put it recently, &quot;If you're losing at a game that
you can't afford to lose, change the rules&quot;.  We've been trying since at least
the mid-1960s to move the insecurity away from the computer using an entire
industry's worth of gadgets and tricks, and yet we're falling further and
further behind the attackers.  The external-authorisation-box approach changes
the rules and instead moves the computer away from the insecurity.  Since the
only interface to the computer is &quot;feed in blob&quot; and &quot;retrieve blob&quot;, it
doesn't matter how insecure the surrounding environment is, there's not much
that it can do to the auth-box.

&gt;<i>BTW, Peter, are you aware that your device looks similar to the one proposed

I had the feeling it sort of collapsed under its own complexity, the smart
card/EMV/etc problem that I referred to earlier.

The external device emulates a standard USB memory key, to send data to it you
write a file, to get data back you read a file (think &quot;/dev&quot;).  There's no
device driver to install, and no particularly tricky programming on the PC
either.
