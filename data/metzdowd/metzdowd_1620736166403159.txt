You misunderstand me.  We can for the most part easily identify encrypted
data, either it is using a standard like SSL or it is non-standard but can be
identified by data payload characteristics (i.e. random bits).  If it is a 
standard
(or even a defacto standard like Skype) we can require access under proper
authority.  If it is not (or access under authority is refused), then just 
simply
block or drop the packets, there's no need to inspect them.
