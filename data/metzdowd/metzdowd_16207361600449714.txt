I'm sorry, but that's a slur. Hushmail is not a scam. They do a very  
good job of explaining what they do, what they cannot do, and against  
which threats they protect. You may quibble all you want with its  
*effectiveness* but they are not a scam. A scam is being dishonest.

You also mischaracterize the Hushmail system. The &quot;classic&quot; Hushmail  
does not generate the keys, and while it holds them, they're  
encrypted. The secrets Hushmail holds are as secure as the end user's  
operational security.

I know what you're going to say next. People pick bad passphrases,  
etc. Yes, you're right. That is not being a scam.

They have another system that is more web-service oriented, and they  
explain it on their web site far better than I could. It has further  
limitations in security but with increased usability. It is also not  
a scam.
