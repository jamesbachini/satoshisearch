&quot;Connection latching&quot; and &quot;connection-oriented&quot; IPsec APIs can address
this problem.

Solaris, and at least one other IPsec implementation (OpenSwan?  I
forget) makes sure that all packets for any one TCP connection (or UDP
&quot;connection&quot;) are protected (or bypassed) the same way during their
lifetime.  &quot;The same way&quot; -&gt; by similar SAs, that is, SAs with the same
algorithms, same peers, and various other parameters.

A WGLC is about to start in the IETF BTNS WG on an I-D that describes
this.
