Subject: NIST considering submissions of block cipher modes

FYI, in recent months, NIST received submissions for three new modes of 
operation for the AES, one of which NIST is now proposing to approve for 
government use.

In particular, on Thursday NIST initiated a 90-day period of public 
comment  (ending September 3, 2008), on the XTS encryption mode of the 
AES, submitted by the P1619 Task Group of the IEEE Security in Storage 
Working Group.  NIST proposes to approve the algorithm by reference to 
IEEE Stnd 1619-2007.  For additional information, see the Request for 
Public Comment on XTS, at 
<A HREF="http://www.csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/documents/Request-for-Public-Comment-on_XTS.pdf">http://www.csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/documents/Request-for-Public-Comment-on_XTS.pdf</A>  
.  The request includes a link to the relevant extract of IEEE Stnd 
1619, which IEEE has agreed to make available free of charge during the 
public comment period.

NIST also would welcome public input on whether to propose either of the 
other two modes for approval:
   1.  Synthetic IV (SIV), an authenticated encryption mode submitted by 
Rogaway and Shrimpton, and
   2.  Feistel Finite Set Encryption Mode (FFSEM), submitted by Spies.
Both submissions are available on the &quot;Modes Development&quot; page of the 
NIST website, 
<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html.">http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/BCM/modes_development.html.</A>
Comments may be submitted to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">EncryptionModes at nist.gov</A>; please identify 
the mode(s) somewhere in the subject line.
