<PRE>Secure64 Develops First Automated DNSSEC Signing Application to Help 
Secure the Internet Worldwide
<A HREF="http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20080730005428/en">http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20080730005428/en</A>

from above:

Secure64 Software Corporation has developed a product that
dramatically simplifies the implementation and management of
DNSSEC. Secure64 DNS Signer&#8482; is the first and only product that
addresses each of the obstacles that have slowed the widespread
deployment of DNSSEC zone signing, including the need for simplicity,
security, auditability and scalability. While recent patching efforts
have mitigated the impact of the cache poisoning vulnerability
identified by Dan Kaminsky and widely reported by the media,
deployment of DNSSEC is widely regarded as the only viable long-term
solution to securing the Domain Name System (DNS).

One of the people behind Itanium design ... was one of the Secure64
founders ... somewhat as part of demonstrating what could be done with
features that had been included in Itanium chip architecture. I've
noted before that they had been heavily involved in earlier RISC chip
efforts ... including original 801 risc chip. misc. past posts
mentioning 801, risc, romp, rios, somerset, fort knox, power/pc, etc
