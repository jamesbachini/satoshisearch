Microsoft broke this in IE7... It is no longer possible to generate and
enroll a client cert from a CA not on the trusted root list. So private
label CAs can no longer enroll client certs. We have requested a fix,
so this may come in the future, but the damage is already done...

Also the IE7 browser APIs for this are completely different and rather
minimally documented. The interfaces are not portable between browsers,
... It's a mess.
