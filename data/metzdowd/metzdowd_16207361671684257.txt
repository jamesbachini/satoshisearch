</I>&gt;<i> Warrantless wiretapping and so on, and private communications eavesdropping are done more efficiently and covertly directly at the ISPs (hence the name &quot;warrantless wiretapping&quot;), where SSL/TLS protection does NOT apply. There is a security gap at every negotiated SSL/TLS session.

You don't take into account the many users these days who use wireless
Internet access from their laptop computers, typically essentially
broadcasting all network data to whoever is sufficiently close and
sufficiently nosy.  Of course using SSL/TLS for e-mail security does
not *solve* the problem of e-mail eavesdropping (unless special care
is taken within a closed group of users), but it certainly plays an
important role in countering eavesdropping in some relevant scenarios.
