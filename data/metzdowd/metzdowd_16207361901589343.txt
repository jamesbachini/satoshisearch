<PRE>One attack on services, which use personal questions as a backup
form of user verification, works well for high-profile users of
these systems. The attack is very simple. Go into the password
recovery page, and use Google to look up the answers to the
personal questions asked. There is enough Googleable data around
for high-profile people, and perhaps not so high profile people,
that the attack can be successful often enough to be useful. My
sources say Sarah Palin's email account was breached using this
attack.

Cheers - Bill
