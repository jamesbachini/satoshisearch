This struck me oddly as well. I cannot think of a single significant
Internet attack which has been traced to any terrorist organizations. I
would agree that this article seems to be designed to alarm rather than
inform, and, no doubt, pick up a government contract.

Additionally, the author seems to make a big deal about asymmetric
encryption without considering how key exchange is accomplished. The
logistics of key exchange remains one of the vulnerabilities any
asymmetric encryption system.
