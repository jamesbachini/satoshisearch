<PRE> From an article about WAN optimization appliances in Computerworld:

	In some markets, such as health and finance, [hiring] a managed
	provider [who will do the encryption &quot;outside&quot; your routers] isn't 	a  
good option for another reason: Because data is optimized in an 	 
unencrypted state, privacy and security concerns arise. But vendors 	 
such as Riverbed, Juniper Networks and Blue Coat Systems can serve 	as  
a trusted &quot;man in the middle&quot; for optimizing data encrypted with 	SSL,  
which is commonly used in applications with Web interfaces and 	other  
Internet traffic. They terminate the encrypted session,
	decrypt, optimize and then re-encrypt and forward the traffic.
	[Gartner's Joe] Skorupa said most vendors are developing this
	useful capability.

It may indeed be a useful capability - but widespread use will destroy  
what little is left of the SSL trust model.
