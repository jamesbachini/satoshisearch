</I>I believe something like this has been written into law.  The reporting
laws are all state laws, so of course vary.  The Federal laws often
have &quot;safe harbor&quot; provisions for encrypted data.

Regardless of the law, the broad public perception is that &quot;encrypted&quot;
means &quot;safe&quot;.  After one too many embarrasments, corporations (and
governments) have learned that &quot;Oh, yes, 150,000 credit card numbers
were stolen but there's no evidence anyone is using them&quot; no longer
works as damage control; but &quot;Oh, yes, 150,000 credit card numbers
were stolen but that's OK - they were encrypted&quot; works fine.  (Note
that these announcements don't even bother to discuss what the
encryption mechanism might be - ROT13, anyone?)

Unfortunately, the technical nature of these results - combined with
the &quot;We told you to encrypt everything to make it safe; now we tell
you encryption isn't safe&quot; nature of the debate, is unlikely to produce 
anything positive in the general public sphere.  People will probably
just shrug their shoulders, figure nothing can be done, and move on.
