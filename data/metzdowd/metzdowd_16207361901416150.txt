Are the primes actually known, or just &quot;guaranteed to exist&quot;?

In what sense is this &quot;impressive security&quot;?

    - Impressive 10 MB wide RSA signatures?
    - Impressively long time on super-computers to verify said signatures
    - Impressively few potential users, with at most one known key pair?

This is likely real progress in computational number theory, but it is
not clear how it is an advance in &quot;security&quot;.
