  election judges throughout the city noticed voters whose street
  addresses start with the number 5 were being denied their voter
  cards because the database wrongly counted them as absentee
  voters...Those whose street numbers start with the number 5
  were designated absentee ballot applicants as part of a state
  test program that should not have been forwarded for Election
  Day use.

Luckily it was an off-year election so:

   only about 10 people were either sent to City Hall to clear up
   the matter or walked away from the polls without casting a ballot

My house number starts with &quot;3&quot; :-)
