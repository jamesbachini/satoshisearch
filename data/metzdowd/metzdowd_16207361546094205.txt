That's right, you have.  As I recall, the last time you posted here was
when you tried to defend RSA's decision to sell no-human-interaction
tokens.  At that time, I asked you whether you were posting for yourself
or whether someone at RSA had asked you to post here, and you declined
to respond.

I think it's important that we know, when flaws in commercial
cryptographic products are being discussed, what the interests of the
parties to the discussion are.  So, I'll ask again, as I did last time:
when you post here, both in this instance and in past instances, is it
at your own behest, or that of RSA?
