I would love to see a mode like freenet's silent bob, where connectors
must prove probable knowledge of the host key before the node will
talk.

&gt;<i> 5. block sending host key fingerprint for invalid or no username
</I>
This makes some sense...

1. Client may request proof of host private key.
2. Client must authenticate.
3. Client may request a copy of the host public key.
