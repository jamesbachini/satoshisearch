Except that the guy who posted it was wrong on all of his complaints.  
It's plenty documented. The &quot;What's New?&quot; section in the manual  
documents it, the release notes document it and others.

We're examining how we document things. If you put in the release  
notes for a product and the &quot;What's New&quot; section a description of a  
feature and someone who is a security researcher can't find it there,  
it calls into question how one organizes one's documents, of course.

If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer them.
