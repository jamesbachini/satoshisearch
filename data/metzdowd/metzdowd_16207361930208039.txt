<PRE>Suppose one has a system that automatically signs you on to anything if 
your cell phone is within bluetooth range of your computer, and 
automatically signs you off out of everything, and puts up a screen 
saver that will not go away, when your cell phone is out of range of 
your computer.

What is the basis for cloning resistance of a cell phone with blue tooth?

NFC provides physical authenticity - privacy on the model of whispering 
one's ear, and authentication by touching.  Is there any mechanism 
intended for mapping that to keys, so that when two NFC devices meet, 
they can give each other petnames, and subsequently recognize public 
keys by petname?
