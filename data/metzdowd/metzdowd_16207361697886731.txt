I think a much bigger reason for its non-acceptance was that it wasn't there
(either present or available or accessible) in most cases.  The PRNG in VIA's
C7 series hasn't had any of these problems, and is supported out of the box by
a pile of software and even some distros (typically via /dev/random).
