<PRE>&gt;<i> Out of curiousity, Vista (BitLocker) was not mentioned?
</I>
BitLocker lacks centralized management, and has very limited key
recovery capability. Also it is limited to Vista Business or Ultimate
Edition.

BitLocker, if you are not using a external USB device to store the
key, falls back to volume level encryption.
