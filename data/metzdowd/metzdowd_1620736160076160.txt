Kerberos V manages in one round-trip.  And it could do one round-trip
without a replay cache if it used ephemeral-ephemeral DH to exchange
sub-session keys.  (OTOH, high performance, secure replay caches are
difficult to implement, ultimately being limited by the number of write
to persistent storage ops that the system can manage.)

I think you might want to say that &quot;three messages is the minimum for
mutual authentication with neither a replay cache nor a trusted third
party negotiating a key for use during the authentication exchanges.&quot;
Or something along those lines.

Of course, you might claim that the TGS exchanges should be added to the
number of messages needed for AP exchanges, but if you re-authenticate
often then you amortize the cost of the TGS exchanges over many AP
exchanges.

I think first and foremost we need authentication protocols to be
secure, while at the same time being algorithm agile.  I think you can
generally manage that in 1.5 round-trips optimistically, more when
optimistic negotiation fails.  And you can do better if you have
something like a KDC that can do negotiation out of band.
