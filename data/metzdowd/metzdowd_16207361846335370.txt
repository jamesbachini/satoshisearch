<PRE>A recent press release about a new cryptographic product, &quot;Permanent  
Privacy&quot; (P.P.), mentioning my name, has led to a slew of  
dramatically mistaken reports. Corrections: I have never had a  
cryptography-related connection to Harvard. I had nothing to  do with  
the press release.

Concerning my alleged support for the claim that P.P. provides  
&quot;...the world's first practical data encryption system that is  
absolutely unbreakable.&quot;:

Its &quot;practical&quot; versions are not &quot;absolutely unbreakable&quot;, as I tried  
hard to convince them. The only claim I ever supported was that if  
the additive stream cipher that is one component of P.P. consists of  
a properly managed 'One-Time-Pad', it (obviously) provides  
unbreakable encryption.
