Having been a notary in the State of California (Shocked myself, 
got 100% on the test!) I can attest that the contents of the 
document are looked at, but only so that I could record what 
*type* of document I was notarizing, not the exact textual 
meaning of the content or whether it might or might not allege 
something that is untrue.

The description of the document in my log book was always 
relatively short as there was only space for about 20 words.

The requirements are simple, see that the document you are 
notarizing has as many pages it says it does so that the count 
can't be changed without arousing suspicion, and the the person 
who is signing the paper is identified by enough documentation 
that I could be assured, within the limits of my ability to give 
a superficial, not expert, less than ten minutes perusal of the 
identification documents presented match the person presenting 
them to the best of my ability to judge.

Best,

Allen

It always was a good faith certification, not a proof beyond 
challenge.
