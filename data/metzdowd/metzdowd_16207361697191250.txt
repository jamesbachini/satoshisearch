Excerpt:

    Today eight colleagues and I are releasing a significant new
    research result. We show that disk encryption, the standard
    approach to protecting sensitive data on laptops, can be defeated
    by relatively simple methods. We demonstrate our methods by using
    them to defeat three popular disk encryption products: BitLocker,
    which comes with Windows Vista; FileVault, which comes with MacOS
    X; and dm-crypt, which is used with Linux.
