It is useful and efficient to get trust from third parties, 
but not essential, imho.  If you find yourself meeting 
someone for the first time in random circumstances, you can 
get to know them over time, and trust them, fully 2nd 
party-wise.

Trust comes from events of risk and reward, not from 
channels.  It just so happens that the best expressions of 
risk and reward are over independent therefore 3rd party 
channels.

Trust is an expression of something you may rely on.  It has 
risks, liabilities, obligations, etc.  Information does not 
(yet).

Well.  Actions speak louder than words.  The *act* of a 
third party is to put their own reputation at risk if they 
say &quot;trust this 2nd person.&quot;  This works if the two people 
are independent, but not if the two people are dependent (or 
the same).  If they are independent, the costs incur to one 
party and the benefits incur to another party.

So the independent cost of placing the reputation at risk is 
a significant event.  You can rely on someone who will incur 
cost on your behalf.  Saying &quot;trust me&quot; carries no risks 
because the benefits cancel out the risks.

Attempting to cast trust as a aspect of channels is a 
technological approach, and will lead one astray, just as 
PKI did;  trust is built on acts, of humans, and involves 
parties and events, risks and rewards.  The channels are 
incidental.

You can see this better in the study of negotiation.  It is 
possible using this theory&amp;practice to build trust, or to 
prove that no trust can be achieved.  Negotiation is 
primarily a paradigm of two parties.

(Economists will recognise it as game theory, prisoner's 
dilemma, perhaps agent-principal theory, etc.)

Your comment that someone who says &quot;trust me&quot; is in fact 
signalling that they cannot be trusted ... is more clearly 
explained in negotiation.  Often, someone will state up 
front that they want to find the win-win;  which is a signal 
that they are in the win-lose, because real win-win is about 
actions not words, and words in this case would lead to a 
false sense of security.
