The calculus here has little to do with unit profit margins.  It has
everything to do with mitigating product liability suits, recalls,
and bad press.  (You won't read a report of &quot;Chiwonkistan Knock-off

Laptop Catches Fire.&quot;)

It is an industry still reeling from a hit of many megabux in a
recall of perfectly good batteries.  I suspect that kind of insurance
is, in their minds, a small price to pay.
