419 scams are not caused by bad interfaces or bad engineering.
Phishing is, but clearly not all con games are, and con games are
remarkably profitable.

Although it is true that there are better and worse interfaces, and
that many of the interfaces we use right now are rather on the worse
side, it is apparent that one of the issues we have is the astonishing
depth of human stupidity.

To quote a common observation: You can't make things perfectly idiot
proof because idiots are too ingenious.

I was having a discussion over lunch about a week ago with a couple of
pretty well known security people (one of them might pipe up on the
list). We were considering what would happen in a particular seemingly
foolproof system with a trusted channel if someone got a message via
an untrusted channel saying...

  &quot;Now, to complete your book purchase, the trusted system is going to
   say &quot;If you press &quot;YES&quot;, you're going to send all the money you
   have in the world to a con man in Nigeria&quot; -- this is
   normal. Please press yes when it says that.&quot;

...a large fraction of users would just press &quot;YES&quot;.

I don't want to claim that there is no place for better human factors
work in security engineering. There clearly is. However, I will
repeat, that is not the only story here, and it is not unreasonable to
note that there are people who are clearly nearly impossible to
protect with almost any level of human factors engineering and
security technology.
