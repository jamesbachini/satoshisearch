It sounds like: we cannot make secure OS because it is too large --
let us don't bother to make a smaller secure OS, just add some more
software and hardware to an existent system and then it will be
secure. Sounds like a fairytale :-)

Data at rest encryption is good since it protects data on lost
laptops, but it does not work against malware (if power is off,
malware does not run as well), especially if the data is used in
decrypted form on the running system. Probably with data at rest
encryption you can protect rarely used sensitive data, but not the
data you use regularly (by the way, how you are going to make sure
that you remove all malware when you work with that sensitive data?).

Now consider trusted paths: adding an additional `secure' button is
easy (MS was able to add more keys to our keyboards), but how you make
sure that (1) there is a trusted path from computer to user and (2)
users understand how to use and actually use it? There are many ideas
how to achieve the former, but apparently the latter always fails.

Fingerprint readers are added not because this adds much security (it
is reported to be easy to fool them once an attacker has a sample of
the fingerprint, and you are very unlikely to keep your computer free
from your fingerprints), but because USERS LIKE THEM: finger scanning
is faster than entering the password and seems to be more secure. I
suspect that if you use some data at rest protection and lose your
laptop while it is not completely off, the fingerprint reader is
counterproductive.

Using embedded hardware to scan for viruses seems not very realistic:
you probably can use it to check parts of RAM that are not supposed to
be changed, but a lot of malware live outside of those areas.

Malware already evolved to P2P communication and thus it is
almost impossible to find the real master by tracing local
connections between hosts.

That is you propose to create a law that all malware must have some
key escrow mechanism? Or you mean that police should be able to force
every user to decrypt data sent to/from their computer? Both are
hilarious, but the sad thing is that in some countries each of them
can become a real law.
