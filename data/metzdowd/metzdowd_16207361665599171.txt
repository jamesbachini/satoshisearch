 &gt;&gt; SSL is layered on top of TCP, and then one layers
 &gt;&gt; one's actual protocol on top of SSL, with the result
 &gt;&gt; that a transaction involves a painfully large number
 &gt;&gt; of round trips.

 &gt; Perhaps theoretically painful, but in practice this is

The delay is often humanly perceptible.  If humanly
perceptible, too much.

 &gt; The benefits of layering for outweigh the perceived
 &gt; gains of just merging it all together into one glob.
 &gt; For example, the ability to replace layers, or replace
 &gt; them by just dropping in a new library.

Compilation would provide the same benefits, and a fair
bit more - such as built in protocol negotiation, rather
than protocol negotiation being reinvented ad hoc in a
different and incompatible way each, and bolted on after
the fact in a different way each time.
