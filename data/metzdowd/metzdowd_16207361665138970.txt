Book.  I concluded, to my horror, that *nothing* in it, including an
A1-rated system, would have stopped the worm from spreading.  Being
rather new to the theoretical security game (though I'd caught my first
hackers around 1971), I asked someone older and wiser.  &quot;Oh, no; a B2
system would have prevented it.&quot;  I asked how.  &quot;B2 requires a thorough
search for bugs.&quot;

Worms and viruses have essentially nothing to do with the operating
system.  As long as whatever context the vulnerable application is run
in -- the mailer, the browser, the word processor, whatever -- can
write to the network or to a file, the malware can spread.

Another approach is to run such things at a lower privilege level.
(Vista does that with IE7.)  The problem is that you sometimes have to
cross the barrier; that's another way the malware can spread.

Your suggested approach -- better OS and better crypto -- is exactly
what's failed for the last 25 years.

If you included all applications as part of the OS, you'd be right --
except that it isn't possible to secure such a code base.
