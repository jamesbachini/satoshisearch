I don't see how this invalidates my analogy.

In 1940 they didn't know understand about wind-induced vibration and yet 
it brought down the Tacoma Narrows bridge.  A few years ago we didn't know 
much about hash collisions, yet since then the field has brought down MD5.

If the field isn't codified, all the more reason to spread knowledge 
rather than encourage a priesthood.
