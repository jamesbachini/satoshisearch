I think there's a large gulf between the use case where the relying 
party and the CA are the same entity, and where they do not even have a 
contractual arrangement.

CAs within a corporate environment may well be a good idea in some 
cases, indeed. As you know, we've been pushing on this idea at the 
Apache Software Foundation for some time now, hindered only by our 
laziness :-)
