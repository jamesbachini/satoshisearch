Yes, I guess it is... hadn't thought of it that way. But yes, I confirm 
that I meant to do the encryptions in place.

It's a degenerate case of Rivest's All-or-nothing transform (which 
applies to larger, multi-block blocks, if you know what I mean :-) ). I 
believe he gave a security proof, some 6ish years ago. But I could be 
confabulating.
