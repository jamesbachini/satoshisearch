I can confirm that they definitely use imagery even when a valid
transponder is detected.  A couple years or so ago I had to put my
vehicle in the shop and use the wife's for a few days.  I assumed that I
could use my TxTag in her vehicle, and it would simply bill my account,
however a couple of weeks later I received a bill for the tolls, billed
to the owner of her vehicle at our address.  When I called to inquire,
they informed me that it did read the transponder, but mismatched with
the plates.  There was a grace period during which I could update the
transponder to the new vehicle and avoid the fines, but as I would be
getting my vehicle back in a few days, I opted to just order a second
transponder for her car.  They were kind enough to transfer the tolls to
the new transponder and waive the fees.
