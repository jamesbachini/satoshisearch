&gt;<i> We've recently had to jump through the BIS crypto export hoops at
</I>&gt;<i> OLPC. Our systems both ship with crypto built-in and, due to their
</I>&gt;<i> Fedora underpinnings, allow end-user installation of various crypto
</I>&gt;<i> libraries -- all open-source -- through our servers. It was a
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare; the regulations and paperwork appear to be designed for the
</I>&gt;<i> use case of individual applications that utilize a handful of
</I>&gt;<i> primitives and attempt to keep the user from examining or modifying
</I>&gt;<i> the utilized crypto. Trying to fit a Linux distribution into this
</I>&gt;<i> model proved, er, challenging.

Debian has been filing notices for crypto export for years (at BXA for
some time; nowadays, it's likely BIS).  So far, nobody there has
complained that what is being done is insufficient.

Here are some details: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain">http://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain</A>&gt;
The actual process may have changed a bit over the years.
