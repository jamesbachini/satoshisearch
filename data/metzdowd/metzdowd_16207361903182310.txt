&gt;<i> On a semi-related topic, it'd be interesting to get some discussion about FF3 
</I>&gt;<i> removing the FF2 SSL indicators of the padlock and (more visibly) the 
</I>&gt;<i> background colour-change for the URL bar when SSL is active and replacing it 
</I>&gt;<i> with a spoof-friendly indicator that's part of the favicon, i.e. part of the 
</I>&gt;<i> attacker-controlled content.
</I>
To keep this in perspective, note that you could disable the location
bar altogether in FF2 (and that default changed in FF3), so the FF3
approach is actually an improvement.
