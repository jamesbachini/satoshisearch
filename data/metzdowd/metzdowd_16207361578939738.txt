Primitive form - maybe, weak form - absolutely not. It 
is actually worse than having no security at all, because 
it tends to create an _illusion_ of protection. 

Which is by the way exactly the case with SecureIM. How 
hard is it to brute-force 128-bit DH ? My &quot;guesstimate&quot;
is it's an order of minutes or even seconds, depending
on CPU resources.
