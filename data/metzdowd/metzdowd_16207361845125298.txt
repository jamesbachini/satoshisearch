<PRE>I thought this list might be interested in a mini-rant about DNS source 
port randomness on my blog: <A HREF="http://www.links.org/?p=352.">http://www.links.org/?p=352.</A>

Ever since the recent DNS alert people have been testing their DNS 
servers with various cute things that measure how many source ports you 
use, and how &quot;random&quot; they are. Not forgetting the command line 
versions, of course

dig +short porttest.dns-oarc.net TXT
dig +short txidtest.dns-oarc.net TXT

which yield output along the lines of

&quot;aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd is GREAT: 27 queries in 12.7 seconds from 27 ports with 
std dev 15253&quot;

But just how GREAT is that, really? Well, we don'
t know. Why? Because there isn't actually a way test for randomness. 
Your DNS resolver could be using some easily predicted random number 
generator like, say, a linear congruential one, as is common in the 
rand() library function, but DNS-OARC would still say it was GREAT. 
Believe them when they say it isn't GREAT, though! Non-randomness we can 
test for.

So, how do you tell? The only way to know for sure is to review the code 
(or the silicon, see below). If someone tells you &quot;don't worry, we did 
statistical checks and it's random&quot; then make sure you're holding on to 
your wallet - he'll be selling you a bridge next.

But, you may say, we already know all the major caching resolvers have 
been patched and use decent randomness, so why is this an issue?

It is an issue because of NAT. If your resolver lives behind NAT (which 
is probably way more common since this alert, as many people's reactions 
[mine included] was to stop using their ISP's nameservers and stand up 
their own to resolve directly for them) and the NAT is doing source port 
translation (quite likely), then you are relying on the NAT gateway to 
provide your randomness. But random ports are not the best strategy for 
NAT. They want to avoid re-using ports too soon, so they tend to use an 
LRU queue instead. Pretty clearly an LRU queue can be probed and 
manipulated into predictability.

So, if your NAT vendor is telling you not to worry, because the 
statistics say they are &quot;random&quot;, then I would start worrying a lot: 
your NAT vendor doesn't understand the problem. It's also pretty 
unhelpful for the various testers out there not to mention this issue, I 
must say.

Incidentally, I'm curious how much this has impacted the DNS 
infrastructure in terms of traffic - anyone out there got some statistics?

Oh, and I should say that number of ports and standard deviation are not 
a GREAT way to test for &quot;randomness&quot;. For example, the sequence 1000, 
2000, ..., 27000 has 27 ports and a standard deviation of over 7500, 
which looks pretty GREAT to me. But not very &quot;random&quot;.
