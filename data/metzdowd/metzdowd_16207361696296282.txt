I think this misses the point. Security is different.

In 2008, I can learn to build pretty good suspension bridges by  
learning the state of the art of bridge-building. After that, as long  
as I live, I run almost no risk of Newtonian mechanics being shown to  
be wrong for any value of wrong that would make me go &quot;well, wow, I no  
longer understand how to build bridges&quot;.

In other words, people who build bridges these days can give you a  
convincing presentation, based on solid physics and a highly-complete  
threat model (soil erosion, material failure, etc) that their bridge  
will do its job. They can say &quot;this bridge will work because it  
satisfies well-understood and reasonably immutable laws of nature&quot;.

People who attempt to build secure systems have no ultimately well- 
understood (let alone immutable!) requirements to design against. A  
good approximation is &quot;a secure system is one that survives all  
relevant attacks that people in our field have come up with thus far&quot;,  
but it's clear that a system successfully meeting that goal can simply  
cease to meet it any given day. Thus unlike with bridges, you  
fundamentally can't evaluate the quality of a security system you  
built if you're unfamiliar with the state of the art of _attacks_  
against security systems, and you can't become familiar with those  
unless you realize that these attacks have each brought down a system  
previously considered impregnable. And if by the time you've gone  
through dozens of broken systems and their corresponding attacks you  
still think you're smart enough to write a new system by yourself,  
you're either very brave or very daft.

Neither of those mean you're a bad person, but both mean you shouldn't  
be designing security systems.
