There are many ways to use DH key-agreement. The one described
on the page is as follows: both A and B generate random values,
exponentiate, exchange results, and derive the same value. In
this case there is no point validating the `public key'
A receives from B: if B colludes with an attacker (and generates
the key belonging to a small subgroup), then B can as well tell
the final secret to the attacker.

The attack would make sense if it allows B to learn a long-term
secret of A, but if the `private keys' are randomly generated on
each exchange, then this problem does not exist.
