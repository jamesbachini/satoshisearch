Not &quot;to the RIM gateway&quot;, &quot;via the RIM gateway&quot; the payload is destined
for a corporate messaging server.

&gt;<i> Something on the

Presumably the device has a KEK, and generates a session key for each
message, encrypting that under the KEK. The KEK is used for a long time
(~90 days) and periodically renegotiated. I don't recall how the KEK is
agreed to. Perhaps there is PKI involved in that step, or it could just
negotiate the new KEK using the current KEK. There is not in practice
any need for a PKI in this context, it looks rather a lot more like
Kerberos than PKI.
