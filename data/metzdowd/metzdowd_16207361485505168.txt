But if you don't do this, customers can repudiate *any* transaction,
even those they have actually issued.  In other words, you run into
tons of secondary fraud, where people claim they are victims, but they
actually aren't.

Customers need to provide some evidence that they are actually
victims.  Just claiming &quot;the virus did it&quot; can't be sufficient.
