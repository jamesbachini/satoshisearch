<PRE>There's a great exchange in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; that pokes fun at
unnecessary secrecy preventing access by legitimate users:

Bond: &quot;Commander Peterson are you equipped with the new XT-7B's?&quot;
Peterson: &quot;That's top secret.  How do you know about them?&quot;
Bond: &quot;From the Russian translation of one of your service manuals&quot;

Reading through a recent malware paper I think I've found the computer
equivalent: &quot;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Internet
Miscreants&quot; contains a section (section 3.1.1) in which the researchers try to
determine compromised card information by country:

  The official BIN number database is not available to the public.  We use a
  BIN list containing information for 52,492 banks [...] which we acquired as
  part of the source code of a channel service bot.

(&quot;From the Russian source code of the people the security measure is designed
 to protect against&quot;).

Peter.
