I was impressed by Hushmail?s candor in the above email exchange.  
They generally have been open with their statements.  OTOH I was 
quite disappointed, actually worse than that, about the content of 
their answers.  Hushmail seemed to have a philosophy of doing 
things ?right?.  They developed a product based upon strong, peer 
reviewed algorithms, used well known, common and trusted PGP as a 
design, created an open source implementation, moved ?encryption 
for the masses? closer to reality by addressing some of the 
inconveniences of PKI, located their servers in areas outside of 
the US, were open in discussing the threat models, trust models, 
design and implementation, had people associated with them who were 
known for their commitment to privacy, were adamant about not 
allowing Carnivore to be attached to their systems, were open about 
complying with court orders by saying that the stored data would be 
turned over, but that emails which used PGP in some form would only 
be available in encrypted form.  For all the Snake Oil out there, 
Hushmail seemed to at least have the right attitude and philosophy; 
 they ?got it?.

Now it appears that this attitude and philosophy have changed.  
They didn?t just passively turn over stored encrypted data in 
complying with court requests, but have, at the very least, 
allowed, and much more likely, assisted in the compromising of 
their own systems.  The first decision was to allow a version which 
exposed the passphrase on their servers and make it the default 
configuration.  This opened things up for the second decision, to 
modify their own systems to provide access to the very limited 
window and then actively collect cleartext during this small 
window.  It would be one thing to find out that Hushmail had lax 
security and their systems had been hacked.  But to find out that 
that Hushmail had hacked their own systems, had actively 
compromised their own servers in direct violation of the purpose of 
their business is quite a betrayal.  One not just of the user, but 
of principle.

I know that Phillip Zimmerman was associated with Hushmail for at 
least some portion of time.  IMHO these actions by Hushmail are in 
strong contrast to his essay, ?Why I Wrote PGP.?  and are much more 
in line with the linking of Donald Kerr, the principal deputy 
director of [US] national intelligence,  ?Privacy no longer can 
mean anonymity ?Instead, it should mean that government and 
businesses properly safeguard people's private communications and 
financial information.?

Furthermore, I conjecture that the complicity of Hushmail has 
significantly weakened the entire PGP system.  The active 
compromising of their servers and weak implementation of PGP 
provides an opening for organizations to look at the contents of 
PGP?d email which has been sent to a Hushmail user.  The PGP 
community may now assume that the passphrases of any Hushmail user 
have been compromised.  The number of Hushmail users means that the 
affect to the PGP system is much greater than a keylogger installed 
on a single PGP users machine.
