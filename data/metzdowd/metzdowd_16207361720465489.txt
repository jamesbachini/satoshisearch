<PRE><A HREF="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/scrt/3FF9713E23292846CC25740A0069243E">http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/scrt/3FF9713E23292846CC25740A0069243E</A>

The Dutch government has issued a warning about the security of access keys
that are based on the widely used Mifare Classic RFID chip.


The warning comes in a week when two research teams independently
demonstrated hacks of the chip's security algorithm.


Criminals can use the hack to clone cards that use the Mifare Classic chip,
allowing them to create copies of building access keys or commit identity theft.


The chip is used in payment systems worldwide, such as the Oyster Card in
the UK and the CharlieCard that is used in Boston. Both offer payment
systems that allow for wireless transactions.


The chip is the basis of a national proof-of-payment system for public
transport. A recently published government-issued study by the Netherlands
Organisation for Applied Scientific Research dismissed the potential
security threat, claiming that hackers would take at least two years to
crack the security codes.

A recent report stating that it would take at least two years for the
cryptographic algorithm to be broken and used casually (From the video I'd
say this is optomistic by almost two years):

A Mifare+ fix for the security weaknesses is announced (Mar 12th):

On Monday NXP Semiconductors said they plan to release a new version of the
Mifare chip; the chip that has gained fame lately after its security was
broken by researchers at U. VA. Dubbed the Mifare Plus, the new chip
addresses the exact security problems that its predecessor the Mifare
Classic faced. The new NXP offering is boasting 128-bit encryption over the
original 48-bit.


The NXP press release:
<A HREF="http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1418.html">http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1418.html</A>

There are a couple of things of note.  They are seeking EAL-4+ evaluation
rating (which Windows 2000 has), it uses AES 128 bit encryption, and it has
backward compatibility with the 48 bit encryption,  Also the new cards won't
be available until Q4.

The cost of infrastructure upgrade (equipment cost versus card processing
delay) might cause an adoption lag.

NXP Semiconductors also claims to lead the car access and immobilzation markets.
