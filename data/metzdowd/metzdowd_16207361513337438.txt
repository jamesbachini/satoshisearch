<PRE>Aloha!

I just saw om EE Times that AMD will start to extend their x86 CPUs with 
instructions to support/help developers take advantage of the increasing 
(potential) parallelism in their processors. First out are two 
instructions that allows the developer to get info about instruction 
completion as well as cache misses.

Considering the article by . about analysis of protection mechanism 
against cache based timing attacks for AES [1] one could assume that 
these instructions should be useful for writing side-channel resistant 
implementations

But, do you think that the opppsite is also possible, that these 
instructions might be a possible source for information leackage and 
vector for side-channel attacks, at least local, inter process attacks? 
I get a weird goodie-badie feeling when reading about these instructions...
