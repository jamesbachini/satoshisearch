It's mentioned in the manpage for a function that eventually calls the
function that was (correctly) patched--through a function pointer.  The
incorrectly patched function looks somewhat parallel, but it's not.

There is no local comment in the source code for this particular case of
uninitialized memory access.

AFAIK, this piece of code is not really related and rarely used outside
OpenSSL itself.  And in the OpenSSL case, the fread call always
overwrites the whole buffer, it seems.
