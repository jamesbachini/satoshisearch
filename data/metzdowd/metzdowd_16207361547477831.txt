<PRE>Crossroads is an undergraduate journal.

We'd do well to single out more worth targets for public ridicule  
than CS undergrads.

If you want to help the author, why not educate, rather than  
mocking?  He's obviously been motivated to think about the subject  
matter and to even take the bold step up publishing something.

If you must scold, aim at the advisor, then. But I don't see much to  
be gained by scolding in this case.  Pick someone who's asking for it  
- the vendors of all the products that don't do what their buyers  
hope and wish they would do...
