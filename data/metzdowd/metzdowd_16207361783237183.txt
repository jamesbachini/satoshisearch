</I>&gt;<i> technically savvy - not only leave their mail on an IMAP server,
</I>&gt;<i> but let some provider deal with the headaches of maintaining that
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, most people's mail spends most of its life sitting on a disk
</I>&gt;<i> owned, managed, and controlled by some third party, whose
</I>&gt;<i> responsibilities, not to mention abilities, for keeping that stuff
</I>&gt;<i> secure are unclear to say the least.  On top of that, the legal
</I>&gt;<i> protections for data held by a third party are limited.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have mechanisms for providing end-to-end encryption of messages.
</I>&gt;<i> Messages sent using, say, S/MIME are encrypted on the IMAP server
</I>&gt;<i> just as they are out on the net.  But this only helps for mail
</I>&gt;<i> exchanged between correspondents who both choose to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose I ask for a simpler thing:  That my mail, as stored in my
</I>&gt;<i> IMAP server, spends &quot;most of its life&quot; encrypted, inaccessible even
</I>&gt;<i> to whoever has access to the physical media on which the server
</I>&gt;<i> stores its mail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, this is a funny goal.  If mail arrives unencrypted, anyone with
</I>&gt;<i> access to the data stream can copy it and do what they like.  It will
</I>&gt;<i> inevitably be buffered, even likely stored on a disk, in the raw,
</I>&gt;<i> unencrypted form.  We explicitly leave dealing with this out of the
</I>&gt;<i> equation - only end-to-end encryption can deal with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are two ways of implementation something in this direction:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  	1.  Client only.  The client, whenever it sees a new message,
</I>&gt;<i>  		(a) downloads it; (b) encrypts it using a secret key;
</I>&gt;<i>  		(c) stores the encrypted version back on the server;
</I>&gt;<i>  		(d) deletes the unencrypted version.  The client can
</I>&gt;<i>  		put the encrypted messages in a different folder, or
</I>&gt;<i>  		it can mark them with a header line.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  	2.  Server-assisted.  The client gives the server its public
</I>&gt;<i>  		key.  When a message arrives at the server, the
</I>&gt;<i>  		server (a) generates a &quot;session&quot; key; (b) encrypts
</I>&gt;<i>  		the message using the session key; (c) encrypts
</I>&gt;<i>  		the session key with the client's public key;
</I>&gt;<i>  		(d) adds a header containing the encrypted session
</I>&gt;<i>  		key to the encrypted message; (e) stores the
</I>&gt;<i>  		encrypted message.  The necessary work for
</I>&gt;<i>  		the client is obvious.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In each case, one would probably chose some headers to encrypt
</I>&gt;<i> separately - e.g., the subject - so that one could more easily pull
</I>&gt;<i> them out without decrypting the whole message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, approach 2 greatly decreases the time that messages may
</I>&gt;<i> hang around unencrypted; but approach 1 can be implemented without
</I>&gt;<i> any cooperation from the IMAP provider, which allows it to be rolled
</I>&gt;<i> out even for those who use the large providers without having Google
</I>&gt;<i> and Hotmail and Yahoo! buy into it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>There's an option 2b that might be even more practical: an S/MIME or
PGP/MIME forwarder.  That is, have a trusted party receive your mail,
but rather than forwarding it intact encrypt it and then forward it to
your favorite IMAP provider.
