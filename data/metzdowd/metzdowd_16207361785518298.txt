<PRE>I'm confused about two statements here:

The second bit makes it sound like the stuff that the Debian folks 
blindly removed was one, possibly-useful addition to the entropy 
pool. The first bit makes it sound like the stuff was absolutely 
critical to the entropy of produced keys. Which one is correct?
