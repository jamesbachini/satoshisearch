I don't see why.

The ssh server determines who the packets are for from information sent 
to it by the ssh client.

The ssh client knows on whose behalf it is acting by virtue of being 
invoked by that user (I'll admit this is a simplification of the most 
general case, but I assert my argument is unaffected), and thus is able 
to include the information when it talks to the server.

Similarly, the client end of an IPSEC connection knows who opened the 
connection and could, similarly, convey that information. That data may 
not be available in some OSes by the time it gets to the IPSEC stack, 
but that's a deficiency of the OS, not a fundamental problem.

It seems to me there's no real difference between the two cases.

Cheers,

Ben.
