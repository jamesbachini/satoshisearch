<PRE>I was in my local Large Chain Bookstore last night, glancing at the
history and military history sections.  I was rather surprised to see
Yardley's &quot;The American Black Chamber&quot; for sale -- it's a facsimile
edition published by the Naval Institute Press.  It would have been
nice if they'd added a modern preface or afterword; even without that,
it's a good volume to have around.
