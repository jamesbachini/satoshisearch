Debian seem to be particularly bad for not reporting changes to maintainers,
although other distros do it as well.  I've got a few packages that are
contained in a number of distros and I notice via occasional Google searches
for semi-related items that I'm getting hits to CVS change logs for my code
where someone is repeatedly re-applying some patch to every new version I
release.  All they'd have to do is send me email to say they've made the
change and I can apply it to the master copy, but instead they re-patch every
new release.  In addition because I have no idea where it's ending up, I can't
even send out a notification to say there's a new version out.  It's a very
strange way to &quot;maintain&quot; code.

Peter.
