<PRE>Isn't this just a semantic game on the part of RIM and the government?

The phrase &quot;enterprise customers&quot; would seem to isolate a class of  
customers such that individual customers not using a corporate version  
of the product would see their crypto weakened... and be subject to  
monitoring through the &quot;service provider&quot;
