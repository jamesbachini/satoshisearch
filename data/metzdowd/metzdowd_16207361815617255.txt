How security non-experts screwed up security in systems like WEP and  
PPTP is no mystery to me. How, on the other hand, a real expert at  
_anything_ feels comfortable entering another hard technical field

That a roomful of network experts designing 802.11 didn't hold hands  
and all together chant &quot;bring us a good cryptographer&quot; with such  
maniacal monophony as to rival any Gregorian choir makes me highly  
suspicious about their supposed expertise with _networks_.
