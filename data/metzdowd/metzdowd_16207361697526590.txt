In fact, 32-bit authentication tags are a feature of
SRTP (RFC 3711).

</I>
Not sending a MAC on every packet has difficult interactions with
packet loss. If you do the naive thing and every N packets send a MAC
covering the previous N packets, then if you lose even one of those
packets you can't verify the MAC. But since some packet loss is
normal, an attacker can cover their tracks simply by removing one out
of every N packets.

Since (by definition) you don't have a copy of the packet you've lost,
you need a MAC that survives that--and is still compact. This makes
life rather more complicated. I'm not up on the most recent lossy
MACing literature, but I'm unaware of any computationally efficient
technique which has a MAC of the same size with a similar security
level. (There's an inefficient technique of having the MAC cover
all 2^50 combinations of packet loss, but that's both prohibitively
expensive and loses you significant security.)


&gt;<i> The NSA quote someone - Steve Bellovin? - has repeated comes to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> Amateurs talk about algorithms.  Professionals talk about economics.
</I>&gt;<i> Using DTLS for VOIP provides you with an extremely high level of
</I>&gt;<i> security, but costs you 50% packet overhead.  Is that worth it to you?
</I>&gt;<i> It really depends - and making an intelligent choice requires that
</I>&gt;<i> various alternatives along the cost/safety curve actually be available.
</I>
Which there are, as indicated above and in my previous message.
