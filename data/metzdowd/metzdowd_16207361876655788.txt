I would never rely *exclusively* on any source because then a failure in your 
exclusive source, no matter how magical it is, will bring down your entire 
system.  Use a hardware RNG if you want to, but also XOR in the output from a 
PRNG, and a block cipher in counter mode, and a MAC of the time.  And apply 
the NIST tests on the data you're using, and on the generator output.  And 
don't forget to do [...].

A good randomness/key generator is more an engineering problem than an 
algorithmic one.
