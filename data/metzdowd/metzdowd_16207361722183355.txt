	actually, the DNSSEC specification -used- to support 
	keys for &quot;any purpose&quot;, and in theory you could use
	DNSSEC keys in that manner.  However a bit of careful
	thought suggests that there is potential  disconnect btwn
	the zone owner/admin who creates/distributes the keys as 
	a token of the integrity and authenticity of the data in
	the DNS, and the owner/admin of the node to which the DNS
	data points.  Remember that while you may control your forward
	name (and not many people actually run their own DNS servers)
	it is less likely that you run your address maps - and for
	the paranoid, you would want to ensure the forward and 
	reverse zones are signed and at the intersection, there is
	a common data element which you can use.

	To do what you want, want, you might consider using the
	CERT-rr, using the DNS to distribute host-specific keys/certs.
	And to ensure that the data in the DNS was not tampered with,
	using DNSSEC signed zones with CERT-rr's would not be a bad
	thing.   In fact, thats what we are testing .
