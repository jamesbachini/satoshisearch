The fault here isn't with Nova (or any of the other vendors that use the
Innmax device), it's squarely with Innmax, whose advertising and data sheets
imply that the disk is encrypted with AES without ever mentioning that it's
only ever used in conjunction with the RFID portion.

(By &quot;imply&quot; I mean the specs state &quot;Uses AES encryption&quot;, technically you
could argue that since they never specifically say &quot;All disk data is encrypted
using AES encryption&quot; they'd be justified in storing it in plaintext, but
that's not what someone looking at the spec will interpret it as).

To make it even more confusing, &quot;Easy Nova&quot; is a near-namespace collision with
eNova, who do AES-encrypt the disk contents (well, as far as anyone knows...
anyone here have a eNova X-Wall drive controller and feel like seeing what's
on the disk?).
