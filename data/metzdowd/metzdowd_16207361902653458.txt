Browser UI needs changing.  Login, and account creation, should take 
place on the trusted path, and in a special window, not easily faked - a 
non rectangular window that partially overlaps the browser window, and 
which contains information specific to this computer's past interactions 
with this website.

We could also mandate that you can only login by clicking on a smart 
bookmark, which knows that it is a bookmark to a login, but this would 
involve turning existing sites upside down, which would be a hard sell.
