</I>a)  It depends on who you think it has to be secure against.  Typical
reasoning:  If it's effectively the *client's* information, why/from
whom do I need to protect it while it's on the *client's* machine?
After all, it can only be seen by the client and me.

b)  The way this attack is actually likely to be used is to steal a
&quot;logged-in session&quot;.  If I have the cookie, and can MITM the stream
to the server, I can act &quot;within the logged-in session.&quot;  I don't
need to be able to decrypt the cookied - the real client has no
need to (but in fact there isn't much point in encrypting, while at
rest, the nonce that identifies the &quot;logged-in session.&quot;)

I put &quot;logged-in session&quot; in quotes in agreement with James Donald's
message on this subject.
