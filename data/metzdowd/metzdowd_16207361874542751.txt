Hi Peter,

I checked the chain - goes directly from <A HREF="http://online.ccsf.edu">http://online.ccsf.edu</A>'s 
certificate to Thwate. All of Thwate's on my list expire 
12/31/2020 15:59:59 PM except for the primary root CA which is 
7/16/2036 16:59:59 PM, and the Thwate Extended Validation SSL CA 
which is 11/16/2016 15:59:59 PM.

As to my system clock, I was asked off list about this and here 
is what I said: &quot;(I) Connect to time.nist.gov or one of a long 
list every 24 hours. My clock says 3:00 PDT August 18th and I 
just double checked by re-syncing:

SYNC-ATTEMPT    Host: mizbeaver.udel.edu    Aug-18-2008 15:00:22 
SUCCESS    39678.9169097222    39678.9169243634 
1.46411985042505E-5!

39678.9169243634
39678.9169097222
-----------------
00000.0000146412 (rounded) is I think quite good enough. :)

As to just clicking through, either stupid for not trusting that 
everything is okay, cautious, or just plain curious why. Take 
your pick. ;-&gt;

Allen
