Specifically, the capability exists to allow a one-off unattended reboot of
servers, i.e. you tell the program that at the next reboot, it should
automount the drive without stopping to ask for the password so that the
reboot can continue.  Without this, it would be impossible to run servers with
encrypted drives.  The mysterious &quot;unnamed customers&quot; was a misrepresented
reference to sysadmins who needed the capability to run their machines.

Nothing to see here, move along, move along.
