It's a mater of (lack of) journalism English. The first paragraph phrase:
    &quot;The new technique can crack even complex codes in a matter
    of seconds.&quot;
should have been written as:
    &quot;The new technique may crack even complex codes in a matter
    of seconds.&quot;
The scientific authors, I believe, were more careful. Their technique
still has all the basic problems of QC built in.
