My favorite part of that web site is from their &quot;How it Works&quot; section:

``For example, suppose that the plain text message is simply one 5- 
letter word. At first glance, you would think that this must be easy  
to break. But there are, let us say, about 100 printable characters on  
a computer keyboard, so there are some 100x100x100x100x100 ways of  
producing a 5-letter word.''

So, let me get this straight.  You appear to be using a one-time pad,  
but you discard all output that the robotic hand you send me is unable  
to type on my keyboard?
