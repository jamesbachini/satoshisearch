<PRE>The movie studios live in fear of people stealing their product as it
all goes digital.  There's, of course, always the &quot;analogue hole&quot;, the
point where the data goes to the display.  The industry defined an
all-digital, all-licensed-hardware path through HDMI which blocks this
path.  As we know, Vista goes out of its way to keep all that stuff
&quot;safe from tampering&quot;.

But in this business, there's always someone who's defining different
hardware that cuts the other way.  At least one &quot;someone&quot; is the
DisplayLink alliance.  This is a group of vendors who are supporting a
protocol for connecting video displays to computers over various kinds
of generic connections.  At the moment, USB, Ethernet, and wireless are
on the list.  Products are beginning to appear - LG, for example,
recently announced the LG L206WU, a 1680x1050 display that connects over
USB.  A &quot;virtual graphics card&quot; drives the thing.  You can support up to
6 USB displays, in addition to your existing displays.  The limiting
factor seems to be the CPU.  Intel is involved with DisplayLink, and is
demoing &quot;3D and HD Video on USB and Wireless USB displays&quot; based on some
integrated support in the the Intel graphics hardware at an upcoming
conference.  Vista's Aero is supported.  The press release talks about
watching movies.  There's a reference in one article about the LG that
says watching Blu-Ray disks probably won't work well because so much of
the CPU is used up decoding the disk.  Obviously, if this is indeed the
limitation, it's a temporary one.

No mention anywhere of HDMI or any kind of deal with the movie
industry.  If DisplayLink takes off - and with Intel on the producing
side and at least LG, Toshiba, Kensington already announcing products
it's got a good chance - HDMI is going to have a tough time gaining
a place at the table; and the Blu-Ray/HD-DVD producers are quickly
going to find themselves having to choose whether they are going to
walk away from the vast majority of the market.
