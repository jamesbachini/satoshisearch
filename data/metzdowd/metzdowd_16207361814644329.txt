ROTFLMGO!

But I've got one better for you. The domain name registrar that I 
have been using went out of business and the domain names were 
handed over to another registrar. In order to gain control of 
them again I have to:

&gt;<i> 1. Create a free login ID at www.eNomCentral.com (your domain will not be there just yet)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. In order to verify domain ownership, please do one of the following:
</I>&gt;<i> a) send a copy of your photo ID matching the WHOIS record for the domain or
</I>&gt;<i> b) send a receipt reflecting past payment for the domain
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Please send an email with your login ID, domain name and domain ownership verification to: <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">CustomerCare at eNom.com</A>
</I>
When I asked how they wanted the ID they said a scan of a picture 
of me attached to the e-mail!

Photoshop anyone?

Best,

Allen
