<PRE>&gt;<i> A proposal for a new password hashing based on SHA-256 or SHA-512 has  
</I>&gt;<i> been proposed by RedHat but to my knowledge has not had any rigorous  
</I>&gt;<i> analysis. The motivation for this is to replace MD-5 based password  
</I>&gt;<i> hashing at banks where MD-5 is on the list of &quot;do not use&quot; algorithms.  
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer not to have the discussion &quot;MD-5 is good enough for  
</I>&gt;<i> this algorithm&quot; since it is not an argument that the customers  
</I>&gt;<i> requesting these changes are going to accept.
