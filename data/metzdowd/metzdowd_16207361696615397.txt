<PRE>It seems that disk containing records of the Irish Blood Transfusion
service seems to have been stolen in New York:

Thankfully, the data was encrypted. The head of the IBTS said on

Based on the jackpot odds from:

they are probably thinking around lg(76275360)*10 = 261.84, or 256
bits of key.
