<PRE>What are the rules these days on crypto exports.  Is a review still
required?  If so, what gets rejected?

Just wondering...  I have people at work ask me what the rules are and I
have not kept up with them.  If GnuPG can ship, what gets rejected?  Is
there some magic cryptotech I am not aware of?  (Or is it just theater at
this point?)
