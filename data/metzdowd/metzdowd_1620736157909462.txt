<PRE>Does anyone have information on:

1) The ECAES weakness that led to ECIES
2) Any known weaknesses of ECIES
3) Relative performance figures between ECC routines like ECIES
   and D/H (or possibly RSA, though IES is based on EC-DH)

I can generate the last if these figures are not available.

BTW, I noticed that the latest OpenSSL has some EC functions,
including EC-DH IIRC.  It does not have ECAES or ECIES though.
