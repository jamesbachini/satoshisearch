An assuming read. The article mentions the &quot;Europark Card&quot;; you buy it 
online for $15 (the web site is still up) and it gets you free parking 
in various cities in Australia, US, and Canada.  Here is a link to a 
demo video on YouTube:

Unlike the recent Oyster Card crack (London, UK), Toronto's &quot;free&quot; 
parking problem does not seem to have been caused by bad cryptography -- 
at least, there is no mention of cryptography in the article.  It goes 
to show that there's more to systems security than just crypto.
