Hi--

I'm getting close to finishing up the third edition of _Disappearing  
Cryptography_. If anyone is interested in getting paid to read  
through the book and identify rough spots, I would love to hire you.  
There's not much of a budget, but send me a short note with your  
qualifications and rate. It's about 350 pages. It doesn't matter if  
you're not an expert. I'm looking with people with an interest in  
steganography. If you're just learning you can contribute too by  
flagging sections that are too confusing. Anyone with expertise is  
also welcome.

Thanks,

-Peter Wayner
