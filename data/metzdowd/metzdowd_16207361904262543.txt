A more optimal solution is to have this vulnerability accepted by
the OWASP community as a &quot;Top 10&quot; security vulnerability; it will
have the appropriate intended effect since mitigation to the OWASP
defined vulnerabilities is required in PCI-DSS:

&quot;6.5 Develop all web applications based on secure coding guidelines
such as the Open Web Application Security Project guidelines&quot;
