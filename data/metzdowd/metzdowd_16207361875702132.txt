</I>Funnily enough I was just working on this -- and found that we'd end up 
adding a couple megabytes to every browser.  #DEFINE NONSTARTER.  I am 
curious about the feasibility of a large bloom filter that fails back to 
online checking though.  This has side effects but perhaps they can be 
made statistically very unlikely, without blowing out the size of a browser.

Updating the filter could then be something we do on a 24 hour 
autoupdate basis.  Doing either this, or doing revocation checking over 
DNS (seriously), is not necessarily a bad idea.  We need to do better 
than we've been.
