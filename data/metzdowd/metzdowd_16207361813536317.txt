Not to rain on your parade, but 1,000 messages is *not* a large inbox
and 2 to 4 minutes is a very long time to wait.  You'd need to make this
two orders of magnitude faster before it would have a hope of being
interesting.  (And for me, it would have to be at least four orders of
magnitude faster before I could consider it to be useful.)
