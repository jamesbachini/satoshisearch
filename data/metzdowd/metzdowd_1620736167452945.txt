To this end, I would like to introduce the Gutmann Sound Wave Therapy  
Mobile Enlightenment Unit.

(NSFW if depictions of phallic audio waves are an issue)


Do you know a programmer who believes they can write a replacement for  
SSL in the time it takes to finish their coffee?

Tell tale signs are phrases such as 'proprietary crypto' and 'secret  
algorithm'.

Simply apply the Gutmann Sound Wave Therapy Mobile Enlightenment Unit,  
stand back, wait and breath a sigh of relief - you've just made the  
world a better place.


I'll begin taking pre-orders shortly.

PS: I don't care that the audio wave can't be produced. It's 'artistic'.
