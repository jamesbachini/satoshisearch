<PRE>Anyone know anything about a company called 2factor (2factor.com)?
They're pushing a system based on symmetric cryptography with, it
appears, some kind of trusted authority.  &quot;Factor of 100 faster
than SSL&quot;.  &quot;More secure, because it authenticates every message.&quot;

No real technical data I can find on the site, and I've never seen
a site with so little information about who's involved.  (Typically,
you at least get a list of the top execs.)  Some ex-spooks?  Pure
snake oil?  Somewhere in between?
