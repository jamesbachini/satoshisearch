Highly doubtful. The institutional inertia at DoD/NIST is too great. 
It has been suggested numerous times by numerous concerned parties 
for at least a decade.

Yes. That part is easy, and some people in the system admit designing 
a much better system is quite tractable, as long as it is done in a 
vacuum. However, bureaucracy abhors a vacuum.

My feeling is that the only way that we can overturn the silliness of 
FIPS-140 / CC is for a major defense ally to implement a sane system. 
Five years later, and with a lot of vendor push, it could become a 
third process and the other two could wither over the ensuing 
decades. If we're lucky.
