Absolutely. There is no reason one couldn't build an easy to configure
IPSec. Indeed, OpenVPN could simply use IPSec if its authors wanted
to.

No one has created the easy to configure IPSec, however, so I don't
use IPSec for my own needs.

Myself, I don't handwave away said flaws. I don't recommend that
clients use OpenVPN, for example. On the other hand, most of my
clients can afford to pay admins to spend lots of time on this, and I
couldn't afford to spend the time myself.

Well, it is pretty easy to configure SSH safely. Set it to only use
public keys, copy your private key to the remote host in the
authorized_keys file, and you're more or less done. There is no reason
all the defaults can't be set up for a nice easy to use IPSec based
package in such a way that it requires a deliberate effort to make the
thing unsafe and it is more or less that easy to use.

Unfortunately, people just don't spend nearly the amount of time on
the UI for their IPSec systems that they do on the crypto, so they
spoil all the hard work they've done making the implementation sound
by making it impossible for ordinary people to understand.
