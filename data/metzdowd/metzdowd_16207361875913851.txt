For folks that haven't seen it, next month's Scientific American is
about &quot;The Future of Privacy&quot;:

<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=privacy-in-an-age">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=privacy-in-an-age</A>

The issue contains a nice discussion of &quot;Privacy 2.0&quot; by Esther Dyson.
She writes:

&quot;What is the best way to limit government power? Not so much by the
rules that protect the privacy of individuals, which the government may
decline to observe or enforce, but by rules that limit the privacy of
government and government officials. The public must retain the right to
know and to bear witness.&quot;

I thought this was an interesting contrast to Dan's comment from the
other day:

&gt;<i> the people who make privacy law, legislature and executive
</I>&gt;<i> alike, are afforded precisely zero privacy by
</I>&gt;<i> both the courts and the press.  As such, one has
</I>&gt;<i> to be a truly addled optimist to imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> those who have no privacy are nevertheless willing
</I>&gt;<i> to grant you more privacy than they have, unless
</I>&gt;<i> they are somehow nostalgic for what they themselves
</I>&gt;<i> lost in becoming a member of government.
</I>
... Also, the article &quot;Brave New World of Wiretapping&quot; by Whitfield
Diffie and Susan Landau was also a terrific overview of the history of
wiretapping laws and how changing communications technology has impacted
intelligence operations (and vice versa).
