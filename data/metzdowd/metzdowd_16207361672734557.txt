sorry, I didn't say that TCP required seven round-trips for reliable 
exchange;
the statement was that minimum TCP operation was seven packet
exchange (for reliable operation) .... sort of 3.5 round-trips. That
VMTP (rfc 1045) reduced that to minimum of five packet exchange
(sort of 2.5 round-tips) ... and that XTP got it to a minimum of three
packet exchange (sort of 1.5 round-trips) for reliable operation.

as always, clicking on the &quot;.txt=nnn&quot; field (in rfc summary) retrieves 
the actual RFC.


If there is more than minimum amount of data ... TCP might involve more
than seven packet exchange ... but the minimum packet exchange is
seven packets (not round-trips).
