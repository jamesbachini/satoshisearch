<PRE>The EFF yesterday filed a letter from a number of academic security  
researchers
urging the judge in the MIT &quot;Charlie Card&quot; case to reverse the  
restraining
order.  It can be found on the EFF's case page, at
    <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/cases/mbta-v-anderson/">http://www.eff.org/cases/mbta-v-anderson/</A>

As a security researcher (and one of the signers of the letter to the  
judge), I was
particularly struck by the ironic -- and very unfortunate -- message  
that the court
order sends to our community:  it's safer to irresponsibly blindside  
users and vendors
by publishing about vulnerabilities without warning them first (thus  
denying them
the opportunity to seek a pre-publication gag order).

Surely that's not what that the court or the MBTA seek to encourage  
here.

I blog a bit more about this at
