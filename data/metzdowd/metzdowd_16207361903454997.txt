That may concern you, but I consider it a feature. Instead of 
teaching users to &quot;always click through the damn dialog boxes&quot;, FF3 
says &quot;if you fell for it once, you're going to always fall for it so 
we won't teach you bad habits&quot;. There are arguments for either 
strategy.

Given that few or none of us on this list are actually trained 
interface experts, I'm sure we could debate this until Perry pulls 
the moderator switch again. The salient point is that people who have 
more stake in the game (Mozilla Inc.) have spent longer thinking 
about this than we give them credit for and come to the design 
decisions that they have.
