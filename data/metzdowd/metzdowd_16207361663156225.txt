You might also try &quot;Shamir's split key knowledge&quot; which has been 
around for many years and there is even a demo of how it works as 
part of a great tool for introducing security, encryption and 
similar bits at: <A HREF="http://www.cryptool.org/">http://www.cryptool.org/</A>

I use the tool when teaching classes to executives and even they 
can get it so you know it is pretty easy to follow. Very well 
written explanations.

Best,
