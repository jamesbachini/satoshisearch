 &gt; Put another way, when you tell an sshd whom you wish

 &gt; rather, any key management daemon for IPsec -- do
 &gt; that?  Per-user SPDs?  Is this packet for port 80 for
 &gt; user pat or user chris?

 &gt; I can envision ways around this (especially if we have
 &gt; an IP address per user of a system -- I've been
 &gt; writing about fine-grained IP address assignment for
 &gt; years), but they're inherently a lot more complex than
 &gt; ssh.

This is a particular case of the layer problem I have
been ranting about for years:  Private and authenticated
sessions at layer X do not in themselves correspond to
private and authenticated sessions at layer Y, and for
users to arrange their affairs so that layer X does
indeed secure layer Y generally requires users to stand
on their heads and stick their right big toe in their
left ear.
