</I>Well, he's the guy who actually recovers data from the things.

I think the main issue here is that the older drives used much larger
magnetic domains on the disk, inherently providing a great deal of
physical redundancy, for those with the equipment to make use of it.
Also, the encodings were much simpler and the controllers much less
sophisticated.  Today the controller/head/disk are effectively a single
unit, tightly coupled by complex feedback loops.  The controller writes
data that it will be able to read, adjusting things based on what it
actually reads back.  I've been told - I can't verify this - that in
practical terms today, if you lose the controller, the data is toast:
Another nominally identical controller won't be able to read it.
