Right.  I haven't used the end to end Java stuff, but I believe that
it works.  Unfortunately, when you go to sign up, what you get by
default is a version that is little more than plain old web mail, and
their signup process does not say &quot;if you use the web mail we can read
all your mail and will provide it in plain text if suboenaed.&quot;

That's what I take issue with, promoting web mail as though it were
secure end to end PGP.
