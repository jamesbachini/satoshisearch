<PRE>&quot;Consider Shannon. He didn&#8217;t do just information theory. Several
years before, he did some other good things and some which are still
locked up in the security of cryptography.&quot;

Shannon's crypto work that is &quot;still [1986] locked up&quot;? This was
said (*) by Richard W. Hamming on March 7, 1986. Hamming,
who died when he was almost 83 years old in 1998, was then a
Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.
He was also a retired Bell Labs scientist.

Does anyone about this or what it could be? Or if Hamming was
incorrect?

(BTW, this was a great talk!)
