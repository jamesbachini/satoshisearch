If anyone's interested, I did an analysis of this sort of thing in an
unpublished draft &quot;Performance Characteristics of Application-level Security
Protocols&quot;, <A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/app_sec.pdf.">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/app_sec.pdf.</A>  It
compares (among other things) the cost in RTT of several variations of SSL and
SSH.  It's not the TCP RTTs that hurt, it's all the handshaking that takes
place during the crypto connect.  SSH is particularly bad in this regard.
