But this is not news. It is well known (at least among the Enterprise
Remote Computing wonks) that only the Enterprise RIM service provides
&quot;end-to-end&quot; security, while the consumer service does not. There is
nothing new here. It is not even marketing spin, without your IT shop
hosting your content, it is hosted by providers subject to CALEA, ...

The good news about RIM is that it has been one of the few devices that
actually provides end-to-end security for Enterprises. This has been a
selling point that helped get them a large share of the Enterprise market.
