<PRE>Well, I don't want to start a flame war (drop me a note offline if I'm
coming across as doing so), but I do want to respond to one point.

Similarly, Aram Perez objected to the use of &quot;Military Grade&quot; in the IronKey
promotional materials


However, according to those promotional materials IronKey uses AES-I think
AES-256 although I can't find a reference to 256-bit key use in the chip.  

According to Wikipedia the U.S. Department of Defense (NSA) has certified
AES for Type-1 applications in the U.S. government.  See also, CNSSP-15 and
<A HREF="http://www.nsa.gov/ia/industry/crypto_suite_b.cfm">http://www.nsa.gov/ia/industry/crypto_suite_b.cfm</A>  A little exploring of the
net finds a number of documents that my browser says are housed on domains
ending in .mil that mention the use of AES-in particular for communications
between U.S. and coalition forces.  I think these facts qualify AES as
&quot;military grade.&quot;
