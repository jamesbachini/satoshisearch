Never-the-less, both attacks require the certifier to be compromised!

</I>That's a mighty big &quot;if&quot; -- as in infinite improbability.  Therefore, a
parlor trick, not cryptography.

There are no circumstances in which any reputable certifier will ever
certify any of the &quot;multitude&quot; containing a hidden pdf image, especially
where generated by another party.

The attack requires the certifier to be compromised, either to certify
documents that the certifier did not generate, or to include the chosen
text (hidden image) in its documents in exactly the correct location.

While there are plenty of chosen text attacks in cryptography, this one
is highly impractical.  The image is hidden.  It will not appear, and thus
would not be accidentally copied by somebody (cut-and-paste).

The parlor trick demonstrates a weakness of the pdf format, not MD5.

</I>To be as weak as CRC, the strength would be 2**8.  I've seen no papers
that reduce MD5 complexity to 2**8.

Please present your proofs and actual vulnerabilities, including specific
examples of actual PPP CHAP compromised traffic -- and for extra credit,
actual compromise of netbsd and/or openbsd software distribution.
