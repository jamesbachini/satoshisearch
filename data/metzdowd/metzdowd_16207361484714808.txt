NIST announces the release of draft Special Publication 800-106,
Randomized Hashing Digital Signatures. This Recommendation provides a
technique to randomize the input messages to hash functions prior to
the generation of digital signatures to strengthen security of the
digital signatures. Please submit comments to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">quynh.dang at nist.gov</A> with
&quot;Comments on Draft 800-106&quot; in the subject line. The comment period
closes on September 17, 2007.

NIST announces the release of draft Special Publication 800-107,
Recommendation for Using Approved Hash Algorithms This Recommendation
provides guidance on using the Approved hash algorithms in digital
signatures applications, Keyed-hash Message Authentication Codes
(HMACs), key derivation functions (KDFs) and random number generators.
Please submit comments to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">quynh.dang at nist.gov</A> with &quot;Comments on Draft
800-107&quot; in the subject line. The comment period closes on September

NIST announces the release of D raft Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 198-1 Publication, The Keyed-Hash Message
Authentication Code (HMAC). The draft FIPS 198-1 is the proposed
revision of FIPS 198. The draft specifies a keyed-hash message
authentication code, a mechanism for message authentication using
cryptographic hash functions and shared secret keys. Comments will be
accepted through September 10, 2007. Comments should be forwarded to
the Computer Security Division, Information Technology Laboratory at
NIST or submitted via email to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">proposed198-1 at nist.gov</A> with &quot;Comments on
Draft 198-1&quot; in the subject line. Click here to review the Federal
Register Notice for Draft FIPS PUB 198-1.

NIST announces the release of Draft Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS) 180-3 Publication, Secure Hash Standard (SHS). The
draft FIPS 180-3 is the proposed revision of FIPS 180-2. The draft
specifies five secure hash algorithms (SHAs) called SHA-1, SHA-224,
SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 which are used to condense input messages
to fixed-length messages, called message digests. These algorithms
produce 160, 256, 384, and 512-bit message digests, respectively.
Comments will be accepted through September 10, 2007. Comments should
be forwarded to the Computer Security Division, Information Technology
Laboratory at NIST or submitted via email to <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">Proposed180-3 at nist.gov</A>
with &quot;Comments on Draft 180-3&quot; in the subject line. Click here to
