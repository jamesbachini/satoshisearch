</I>I was going to post something similar.  I maintain several pkgsrc
packages (<A HREF="http://www.pkgsrc.org">http://www.pkgsrc.org</A>); while most upstream maintainers are
happy to receive bug fixes, others range from indifferent to downright
hostile.  For example, I once reported a portability bug to a
developer: POSIX standards *require* that a certain system call reject
out-of-range arguments, and NetBSD enforces that check.  The Linux
kernel (or rather, the kernel of that time; I haven't rechecked lately)
did not.  Fine -- a minor standards issue with Linux.  But the
application I was adding to pkgsrc relied on the Linux behavior and the
developer angrily rejected my fix -- the standard was &quot;stupid&quot;, and he
saw no reason to change his code to conform.

Usually, though, indifference is a bigger problem.  The NetBSD internal
developers' mailing list has seen numerous complaints about *major*
package developers ignoring portability and correctness fixes.  If it
isn't Linux and it isn't Windows, it doesn't matter, it seems.
