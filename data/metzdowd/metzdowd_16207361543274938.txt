Yes, but will it work on my UltraSparc? How about my PPC powermac? Or
maybe my OpenBSD laptop?

What's that - I have to use some opaque mechanism to key my drive? Pass.

And how do I know that the drive didn't just store a copy of my
encryption key in NVRAM somewhere which can be retrieved by reading
some magic sequence of negative sectors? And what about a zillion
other paranoid but reasonable concerns?
