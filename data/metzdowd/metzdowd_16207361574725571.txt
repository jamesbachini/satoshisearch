<PRE>A 307 digit number is 1024 bits, near enough.  1024 bits
was scheduled to fail in 2013.  It has failed early, due
to modest advances in factorization.

Thus past comparisons of the strength of encryption key
sizes are no longer entirely accurate.  Further, they
never were that accurate to start with - one needs
actual run times for breaks run on the same machine.
None of the past comparisons have started from such
concrete data.
