this post references scenario for replacing the SSL server domain name 
certificates with a certificate-less public key infrastructure

<A HREF="http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2008k.html#48">http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2008k.html#48</A> The PKC-only application 
security model

mentions certificate-less X9.59 (financial transaction), 
certificate-less KERBEROS (large number of infrastructure and 
application authentication operation) and certificate-less RADIUS 
(possibly dominant client authentication infrastructure in the world 
today used by lots of ISP, corporate intranets, webhosting operations, etc).

RADIUS provides a generalized authentication, authorization, and 
accounting infrastructure ... where AAA specifics can be specified on an 
account or client basis (i.e. including being able to easily 
accomodating both password and public key concurrently).
<A HREF="http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/subpubkey.html#radius">http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/subpubkey.html#radius</A>

There are even RADIUS &quot;plug-ins&quot; for webservers for doing webserver 
client authentication.

A combination of replacing SSL server domain name certificates with 
certificate-less server operation and
and using certifcate-less RADIUS (client) authentication ... covers 
mutual (client &amp; server) operation.

RADIUS references from our rfc index:
