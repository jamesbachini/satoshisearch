I agree completely. If the PTO does their job, they won't get it.  
This is like claiming that once we know that making daiquiris in a  
blender is possible, it's patentable to improve that by making pina  
coladas. If you're skilled in the art, you know that this is pretty  
obvious. Crypto extended to cryptanalysis is less of a stretch than  
strawberries extended to coconut and pineapple.

Unfortunately, the PTO hands out patents for things like using a  
laser pointer as a cat toy.
