  The first review I read didn't make it clear, but browsing the
manufacturer's website and glossy pdfs suggests that there is indeed only a
single USB connector - but there's an ethernet connector too.  You use it as
an inline device and leave your normal ethernet NIC unplugged.  This is what
they refer to as &quot;wired&quot; operating mode, and given Steven's proviso about
controlling the firmware (and let's hope there's no holes or overflows in the
web admin interface either...) I think that this mode could just about be made
secure.

  The alternative, &quot;wireless&quot; mode, which was what initially I thought it did
all the time, does indeed rely on proxying your network traffic out over the
usb, then back to the main computer, then out over its own NIC - and that, of
course, can easily be bypassed.
