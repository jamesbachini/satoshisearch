I don't know if a product has to meet m of n criteria as stated in  
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.interhack.net/people/cmcurtin/snake-oil-faq.html">http://www.interhack.net/people/cmcurtin/snake-oil-faq.html</A>&gt;, but,  
IMO, IronKey meets the following criteria: Technobabble, Experienced  
Security Experts, &quot;Military Grade&quot; and to a certain extend  
Unbreakability (normally applied to software, but IronKey claims the  
epoxy prevents &quot;criminals from getting to the internal hardware  
components&quot;).

Respectfully,
Aram Perez
