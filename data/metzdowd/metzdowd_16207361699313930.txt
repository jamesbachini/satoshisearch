  Not necessarily a problem, although it does depend on their design.  Even if
by saturating the chip in an intense EM field you can skew the result almost
all the way to 1 or 0, won't the standard debiassing trick of examining
successive pairs of bits handle that?

  The original paper on the clock skew identity tracking technique suggested
that naive randomisation doesn't help; adding a bit of randomisation just
introduces noise into your dataset, but you can still clearly see the slope of
the line they're clustered around.
