I'm beginning to suspect that more often than not, this nonsense is a  
result of market forces rather than idiot technologists. In my  
experience, senior decision-maker types outside of the computer  
industry (and even within it, but perhaps a tad less so) are  
sufficiently non-technical as to never have heard of Kerckhoffs'  
principle -- and to disbelieve it when they do, since it opposes their  
intuition of what makes for secure systems. Various companies (or  
departments) then emerge peddling their home-grown crypto and  
trumpeting the fact that it's proprietary as a feature, commonly going  
hand in hand with stupidly large key sizes.

Some number of these muppets approached me over the last couple of  
years offering to donate a free license for their excellent products.  
I used to be more polite about it, but nowadays I ask that they Google  
the famous Gutmann Sound Wave Therapy[0] and mail me afterwards.

I've never heard back.
