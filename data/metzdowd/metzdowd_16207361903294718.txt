In my experience that's the brontosaurus in the room.  There are vendors out
there that'll do cellphone auth (basic SMS-based out-of-band transaction
authorisation), the technology's in place, the problem is that once everyone
has taken their cut it's no longer economical.  To some extent the technology
still sucks quite a bit (e.g. RSA's SMS-based system takes the bank-side
information &quot;Request authorisation for transfer of $10,000 from your bank
account to the bank account of J.Random Retailer&quot; and turns it into &quot;Enter the
following PIN to unlock all further debits from your account until it's
empty&quot;), but we're getting there.

The killer is the cost involved.  Access to the mobile networks is expensive
enough that I've seen solutions in some countries like buying SMS capacity in
bulk from foreign providers (it's cheaper to send the texts from a provider on
the other side of the world than to do it locally) to the extreme step of
setting up (or perhaps buying up) your own cellular network.

Can you describe the WoW interface?  It sounds like they've taken advantage of
the greenfields approach and built something different that's secure from the
start, but I'm not familiar with how it works.

It's already been done, in situation-specific ways:
