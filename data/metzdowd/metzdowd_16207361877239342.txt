Yeah, I considered this scheme. The problem is that it doesn't really 
help the relying parties, who can still be fooled into believing an 
existing user is returning (or a new one is arriving) from the original 
site. This is particularly a problem for Sun's OpenID Provider, which 
makes the additional assertion (out of band) that the user is a Sun 
employee. So, anyone can become a Sun employee, as of a few days ago.

This is why the lack of CRL checking in OpenID libraries is an issue.

In general, DNS is not fixable without deploying DNSSEC.

a) The current &quot;fix&quot; just reduces the probability of an attack. If 
attacker and victim have sufficient bandwidth, it can still be done in 
under a day.

b) There are many scenarios, mostly revolving around the use of wireless 
hotspots, where users are easily fooled into using a malicious DNS provider.

So, DNS patching is not, IMO, the real answer to this problem. Of 
course, the second scenario has been around forever, but is conveniently 
ignored when explaining why CRLs are not necessary (and all other things 
that rely on perfect DNS). All that's happened recently is we've made 
people who are sitting still just as vulnerable as travellers.

But increasingly we are all travellers some of the time, from a &quot;how we 
get our 'net&quot; POV. We really can't ignore this use case.

Cheers,

Ben.
