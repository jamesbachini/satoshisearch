As far as I recall, the last time Thunderbird had an upgrade it told me 
that one was available, I clicked to upgrade, and the addons, including 
Enigmail, continue to work. When there was an upgrade available to 
Enigmail, same thing. And the upgrade to GNUgpg also installed cleanly 
with no reconfiguration necessary. It has all been as transparent as can be.

My only problem with it is that I keep having this nagging feeling in 
the back of my mind that &quot;set it and forget it&quot; is not the best approach 
to security.
