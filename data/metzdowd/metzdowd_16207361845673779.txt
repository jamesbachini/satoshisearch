This is the first I have heard of this.

That said, some initial observations:

- It's worth asking why, if you're doing per-connection keying,
  it makes sense to do this at the IP layer rather than the
  TCP/UDP layer. 

- Why not simply use TLS or DTLS?

- The uh, novel nature of the cryptographic mechanisms is
  pretty scary. Salsa-20? AES-CBC with implicit IV?
  A completely new cryptographic handshake? Why not use
  IPsec?

- A related idea was proposed a while back (by Lars Eggert,
  I believe). See S 6.2.3.1 of:
