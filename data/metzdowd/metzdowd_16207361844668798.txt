Having been peripherally involved in the causation change for IKE, let
me confess that it was caused by human stupidity destroying the
alternatives. The author of the much cleaner spec asserted copyright
and control over it, and fearing lawsuits, people turned to the
the remaining alternative. A number of us were all to blame for the
situation.

I will point out that the &quot;I Dislike IKE&quot; pins were not rare at
meetings. Most people understood the situation as it happened.
