No, the notary does not have the documents *after* they are 
notarized, nor do they keep copies. Having been a notary I know 
this personally. When I stopped being a notary all I had to 
submit to the state was my seal and my record books.

If I had to testify about a document I would only be attesting 
that the person who presented themselves adequately proved, under 
the prudent businessman's standard, that they were the person 
that they said they were and that I saw them sign the document in 
question. That's it. No copies at all. What would anyone have to 
testify about if a legal battle arose after the notary either 
died or stopped being a notary?

Think for a minute about the burden on a notary if they had to 
have a copy of every document they notarized. What a juicy target 
  they would make for thieves and industrial spies. No patent 
paperwork would be safe, no sales contract, no will, or other 
document. Just think how the safe and burglar alarm companies 
would thrive. Now ask yourself how much it costs to notarize a 
document. Would that pay for the copying and storage. I don't 
know what the current fees are in California but 20 years ago 
they were limited to $6.00 per person per document and an extra 
buck for each additional copy done at the same time. My average 
was about $14.00 per session. My insurance was $50/year. Nowhere 
near enough to cover my liability if I was to retain a copy of 
the document.

Best,

Allen
