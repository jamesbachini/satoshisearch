<PRE>Hi list

Has anybody already gained experience concerning the technical
implementation of SRP (<A HREF="http://srp.stanford.edu">http://srp.stanford.edu</A>)? There is one point I
couldn't find in any documentation: Should the modulus and the generator
(N and g) be unique for each client or can they be chosen
application-wide? What are the (security-related) implications in each
case?

Thanks,

Michael
