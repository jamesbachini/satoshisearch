Lock USB down completely, or block most devices and allow approved
ones?  There is a non-empty set folks doing the latter, which opens
the possibility of this type of device being permitted, while others
are restricted.

Since *all* it needs is the ability to call &quot;home&quot; to its server, and
register to send/receive messages, it will not look like mass-storage,
and should not look like a network interface. Data leakage should not
be a concern if the device is built/marketted correctly.
