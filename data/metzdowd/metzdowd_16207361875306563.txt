This is quite disputable. Further, hand vs. machine counting is core 
to the way we think about the security of the voting system.

On a &quot;complex&quot; ballot, there are maybe 20 races or propositions, some 
of which may allow multiple votes per race. The pre-electronic method 
for hand-counting these was to start with race #1, have one person 
reading each vote out load from a large stack of ballots, and another 
person tabulating. In most districts, this is done twice with 
different people doing the counting and, often, those people coming 
from the &quot;opposite party&quot; in our wonderful two-party system.

The numbers I saw in the late 1970's said that each vote took 2.5 
seconds per ballot per race when done slowly; so that's 5 seconds 
when run twice. Per &quot;complex&quot; ballot, that's about 100 seconds, or 
roughly 2 minutes, or roughly 1/30 of an hour. At current labor rates 
of $12/hour for this type of work (that's high, but we want qualified 
people to count), that means it costs about US$0.40 per ballot for a 
complex ballot.

Essentially no one would argue that is is &quot;quite expensive&quot;. I 
suspect that nearly everyone in the country would be happy to pay an 
additional $1/election for more reliable results.
