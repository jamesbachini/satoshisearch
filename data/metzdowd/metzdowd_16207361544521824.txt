So, is snake oil:

    * a crap product?
    * a fine product with weaknesses?
    * a marketing campaign that goes OTT?
    * a term used to slander the opposing security model?
    * an adjective that applies to any of the above?

OTT == over-the-top, excessive and dangerous.  Derives from 
WW1 trench warfare.
