<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I have been asked to opine on a system that requires a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;two-person login&quot;.  Some AIX documents refer to this as
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;common method of increasing login security&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245962.pdf">http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245962.pdf</A>
</I>
I would like to have a two-person remote login:
The server is in the datacenter, two sysadmins login remotely (SSH or 
something similar), and the login only works if both are there. As soon as 
either one drops the connection, the other one is frozen too.
They should see what each other is doing (key-press logging of the other admin 
in the bottom line)
(In case they detect the other sysadmin doing something evil, they can simply 
disconnect, which also disconnects/freezes the other one)

I would be happy about such an implementation in a SSH server. 
(combined with screen perhaps ...)

Best regards,
Philipp G&#252;hring
