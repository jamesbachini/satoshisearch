No. It really does not. Shannon's tenth theorem is about correcting
lossy channels with statistically random noise. This is about making
sure something bad doesn't happen to your computer like having someone
transmit blocks of your hard drive out on the network. I assure you
that Shannon's theorem doesn't speak about that possibility. The two
are not really related. It would be wonderful if they were, but they
aren't. Indeed, Shannon's tenth theorem doesn't even hold for error
correction if the noise on the channel is produced by an adversary
rather than being random.

I'm not particularly inclined to argue this at length.
