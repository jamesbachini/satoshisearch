<PRE>Yes, of course Adi is correct, but I blame you for reading what I wrote 
and not what I meant... :-)

Adi mentioned that the slides and paper will go online around the 
deadline for Eurocrypt submission; it will all become much clearer than 
my wounded explanations then.

thanks and regards,
Greg.

</I>&gt;<i>             I would like to know how Dinur and Shamir's work differs
</I>&gt;<i>             from Courtois'
</I>&gt;<i>             previous work on Algebraic cryptanalysis of block ciphers.
</I>&gt;<i>              It is a
</I>&gt;<i>             refinement of Courtois' technique?  Greg, do you, or someone
</I>&gt;<i>             else have
</I>&gt;<i>             some insight on this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         I spent about an hour trying to come up with a short but legible
</I>&gt;<i>         explanation of the technique, and failed. Sorry about that. I
</I>&gt;<i>         can visualize it, and could probably reproduce Adi's drawings on
</I>&gt;<i>         a whiteboard, but not with typing. The following is as close as
</I>&gt;<i>         I could come.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         Basically the method focuses on terms of the polynomial in which
</I>&gt;<i>         only one secret bit of the key appears, and many of the
</I>&gt;<i>         non-secret bits. Using chosen (or lucky) plaintexts, vary all
</I>&gt;<i>         but one of the non-secret bits, and sum the output bits (mod 2,
</I>&gt;<i>         that is, XOR). Fix the other non-secret bit to 1. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Now all the terms that involve less than the full complement of
</I>&gt;<i>     non-secret bits will appear an even number of times in the sum, and
</I>&gt;<i>     because it is mod 2, they will all cancel out! The only terms that
</I>&gt;<i>     will be left are the ones with one secret bit, and all ones for the
</I>&gt;<i>     non-secret bits... but that is linear in the secret bit! So what you
</I>&gt;<i>     are left with is a simple, linear, polynomial relating unknown (key)
</I>&gt;<i>     bits. Gather enough such equations, just a few more than the number
</I>&gt;<i>     of key bits will do, and solve the linear system in trivial time.
</I>&gt;<i>     Note that you had to have 2^(d-2) chosen plaintexts to sum over for
</I>&gt;<i>     each of the equations... that's where the complexity comes from. The
</I>&gt;<i>     attack is called Cube because in the case where d=4, each time you
</I>&gt;<i>     sum over all of the varying known bits, it can be visualized as the
</I>&gt;<i>     face of a cube, the corners of which are the possibilities for the 3
</I>&gt;<i>     known inputs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Hope that helps. Note that the formula I typed from memory for the
</I>&gt;<i>     complexity was wrong... it's O(n * 2^(d-2)), if the above is correct.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     For anything more than this, you'll have to wait for the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Greg.
