The device is also sold for use in other high-profit-margin items like laser
printer toner cartridges and ink tanks.  While I can certainly see the point
of your argument as applied to batteries, I haven't heard of too many toner
cartridges exploding recently, and given the extensive bad press given to
dubious tactics like &quot;starter cartridges&quot; I don't think the printer
manufacturers are that worried about publicity issues (the printer ink/toner
market is definitely a racket, and has been documented in some detail
elsewhere).
