</I>&gt;<i>     X; and dm-crypt, which is used with Linux.

While they did have some success with recovering an entire AES key
schedule uncorrupted, it seems important to note that the simplistic
nature of the AES and DES key schedules allowed them to recover the
entire original key even after the state had been somewhat degraded
with only moderate amounts of work. A cipher with a better key
schedule (Blowfish or Serpent, for instance) would seem to offer some
defense here.
