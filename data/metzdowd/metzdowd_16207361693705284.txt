Subject: Re: [IP] Cold Boot Attacks on Disk Encryption

Dave,

The paper published today makes some pretty strong claims about the  
vulnerabilities of Microsoft's BitLocker, Apple's FileVault,  
TrueCrypt, Linux's dm-crypt subsystem, and similar products.

So I put the folks behind it to a test. I gave them my MacBook laptop  
with FileVault turned on, powered up, encrypted swap enabled, and the  
screen saver locked.

They were in fact able to extract the 128-bit AES key; I've put screen  
snapshots of their FileVault bypass process here:

And my article with responses from Microsoft, Apple, and PGP is here:
<A HREF="http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9876060-38.html">http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9876060-38.html</A>

Bottom line? This is a very nicely done attack. It's going to make us  
rethink how we handle laptops in sleep mode and servers that use  
encrypted filesystems (a mail server, for instance).
