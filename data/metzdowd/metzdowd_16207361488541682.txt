The SSH discussion has (in messages I didn't forward) rapidly
degenerated into an argument that isn't very high signal. I'd suggest
that the non-crypto aspects are best discussed on other mailing lists
like the IETF SSH working group lists and the OpenSSH developers
mailing list. If there are specific cryptographic flaws in the
protocol, I'd say they are fair game if the discussion is clear, brief
and dispassionate.
