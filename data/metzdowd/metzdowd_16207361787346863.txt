Quoting:

   It was one of the most iconic and heart-stopping movie images of
   2003: the Columbia Space Shuttle ignited, burning and crashing to
   earth in fragments.

   Now, amazingly, data from a hard drive recovered from the fragments
   has been used to complete a physics experiment - CXV-2 - that took
   place on the doomed Shuttle mission.

Now, this article isn't written from a security perspective, but I
think the implications are pretty obvious: quite a bit can happen to a
hard drive before the data is no longer readable.
