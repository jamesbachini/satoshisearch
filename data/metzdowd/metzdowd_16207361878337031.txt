Based on this reply alone I'm not sure I follow. I also read quickly 
through your exchange on TCPM and your comments appear to be specific 
to Adam's draft.

My comment was not related to either a latency or a potential performance 
problems of TLS. It was in a response to another idea - that of bundling
TLS handshake with TCP handshake. The goal of this (and I apologize for 
stating the obvious, just want to make sure we are on the same page here) 
is to provide transparent to application layer opportunistic encryption 
of TCP streams. Whether this goal makes any sense and if it is worth 
pursuing is a separate issue; it's the DoS aspect of the implementation 
idea that I was commenting on.
