It depends on your requirements.  For a large numbers of computers
owned by a corporation/organization centralized key management
makes a lot of sense.  For a single user with a privately purchased
computer then the recovery password makes more sense.

Agreed, for most requirements.  Sometimes one may need to keep keys
in trusted hardware only.  The only real fly-in-the-ointment is that current
hash algorithms (SHA-1, SHA-2, etc.) don't scale across multiple CPU
cores (assuming you need integrity along with your privacy).
