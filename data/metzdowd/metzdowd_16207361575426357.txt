They already expired.

Some EC primitives in the latest OpenSSL.

But why assume short ECC keys are stronger than long RSA?

AFAIK, the only advantage of ECC is that the keys are shorter.
The disadvantage is that it isn't as well studied.

Although every time I read up on ECC, I understand it, and then within
a few days I don't remember anything about it.  I think they teflon
coated those ideas somehow, because they don't stick.

Why can't they do something like El-Gamal?

I'm not comfortable with RSA somehow.  It seems fundamentally more
complicated to me than DLP, and it's hard to get right - look at how
many things there are in the PKCS for it.
