There is no valid reason to ship snake oil cryptography (at any moment).

There is no standard but a high standard which is appropriate for
comparison.

Since SSL was already available, there was no excuse to do anything
worse.

It seems that you still don't understand those things, or you would not
complain about them even at this far removed date.  How unfortunate.
