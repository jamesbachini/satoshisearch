Hmm, given this X-to-key-Y pattern (your DTLS-for-SRTP example, as well as
OpenVPN using ESP with TLS keying), I wonder if it's worth unbundling the key
exchange from the transport?  At the moment there's (at least):

  TLS-keying --+-- TLS transport
               |
               +-- DTLS transport
               |
               +-- IPsec (ESP) transport
               |
               +-- SRTP transport
               |
               +-- Heck, SSH transport if you really want

Is the TLS handshake the universal impedance-matcher of secure-session
mechanisms?
