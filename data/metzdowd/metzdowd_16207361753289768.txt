traditional approach is to make the compromise more expensive that any
reasonable expectation of benefit (security proportional to risk).

helping bracket expected fraud ROI is an infrastructure that can (quickly)
invalidate (identified) compromised units. there has been some issues
with these kinds of infrastructures since they have also been identified
with being able to support DRM (&amp; other kinds of anti-piracy) efforts.

disclaimer: we actually have done some number of patents (that are 
assigned)
