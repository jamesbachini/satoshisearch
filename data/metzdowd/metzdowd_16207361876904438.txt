There are a set of techniques that allow you to encrypt elements of
arbitrary sets back onto that set. 

The original paper on this is:
John Black and Phillip Rogaway. Ciphers with arbitrary ?nite domains. In 
CT-RSA, pages 114?130, 2002. 

For a modern proposal to make this a NIST mode, see:

Full Disclosure: Terence Spies, the author of the FFSEM proposal,
works for Voltage, Voltage has a product based on this technology.
and I'm on Voltage's TAB and have done some work for them.
