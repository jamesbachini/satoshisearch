I've been (very informally) tracking it for awhile, and for generic data (non-
Platinum credit cards, PPal accounts, and so on) it's essentially too cheap to
meter, you often have to buy the stuff in blocks (10, 20, 50 at a time) to
make it worth the sellers while.  I haven't tracked the big-ticket items like
PPal accounts with guaranteed minimum balances (rather than just any generic
PPal account) because the offerings are too ephemeral, you might get &quot;PPal
with minimum $5K balance&quot; advertised for a few weeks, then &quot;Platinum Visa&quot; for
a few weeks, and then something else again.

I'm not aware of anyone having done this, mostly because the data doesn't seem
to be available.  The phishers don't sell (e.g.) BofA accounts specifically,
they sell whatever's available - you get a block of X accounts or cards from
various banks, whatever's at hand when you buy.  The only way to see whether a
measure was effective would be to keep buying blocks over time and see what
the mix of banks was, and even then it'd be pretty unscientific because you'd
be getting lots from random phishing sources or data thefts which might
(coincidentally) be targetting one particular bank and not another.  Given the
diverse sources for this stuff, it's likely that even the vendors only have a
vague idea of what the statistics are.
