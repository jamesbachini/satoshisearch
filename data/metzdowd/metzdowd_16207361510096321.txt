Which means, if Moore's Law still applies, that in a few years no 
current code created by one of the three letter agencies will be 
safe from prying.

So what is the statute of limitations on invasion of privacy 
suits? Or, if it has expired, then me may have proof available 
that people weren't crying wolf.

I've always loved the old saw, &quot;Be careful what you wish for, you 
just might get it.&quot; My addendum is that you will probably not 
like the unintended consequences.

Best,
