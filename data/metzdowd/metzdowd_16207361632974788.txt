  Not true.  Because they are notarizing a signature, not
a document, they  check my supporting identification,
but never read the document being signed.

 &gt; And yes, they always generate the stamp or imprint
 &gt; they sign. To do otherwise would be irresponsible (and
 &gt; illegal).

If they were to generate an MD5 hash of documents
prepared by someone else, then the attack described
(eight different human readable documents with the same
MD5 hash) works.
