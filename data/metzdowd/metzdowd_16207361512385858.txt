Isn't most of the cost/complexity of super-computers the interconnect
fabric and memory system, not the CPUs... Clearly for easy to partition
problems this beats the &quot;super-computer&quot; systems, but many large problems
won't tolerate Storm's interconnect latency...

The LINPACK benchmarks on super-computers largely measure memory-bandwidth
not CPU power, but the memory pre-fetch pipeline depth is not unbounded,
most algorithms will stall if latency is too high... Simulations of
supernova explosions or aircraft wing dynamics probably don't easily
scale on Storm...
