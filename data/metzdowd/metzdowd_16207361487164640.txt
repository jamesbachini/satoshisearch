<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; The second possiblity has been realized by some european banks now, based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on SMS and mobile phones, which sends the important transaction details
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together with a random authorisation code, that is bound to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaction in the banks database. The user can then verify the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transaciton, and then has to enter the authorisation code on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webinterface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How large is this code?
</I>
5 characters, including numbers and letters. I think you have something like 4 
tries to enter a code correctly.

(rough estimation: 5^30 = 931322574615478515625 / 4 = 232830643653869628906 , 
so you have a chance of 1:232830643653869628906 per transaction if you try it 
4 times)

&gt;<i> The security of this system would seem to rest on the security of mobile
</I>&gt;<i> phones against cloning.  How were mobile phones protected against cloning?
</I>
Well, the security depends on an attacker not being able to infect a specific 
users&#180;s computer with a MitB and knowing and being able to clone this 
specific users&#180;s mobile phone at the same time.

Neat idea!  
It only has the problem that I know several companies already where you have 
to register your USB-stick, and only registered USB-sticks are allowed on the 
network ..., but it&#180;s a neat workaround, yes. 
I think SecurityLayer should be easily adaptable to that concept.
Do you already have an demo implementation of that external device, Peter?
