Clipper (or more specifically Capstone, via the Fortezza card) is a great
example of the NSA's sound engineering approach to generating random data [0].
They used a physical randomness source of an unpublished type, presumably a
standard noise-based source.  And a Skipjack-based ANSI X9.17 PRNG with a pre-
set random seed.  *And* a 48-bit counter.  All were mixed up with SHA-1.  The
design was such that there was no single point of failure in the sources
themselves, so that as long as SHA-1 was at least vaguely useful as a mixing
function the sources themselves didn't have to be totally failure-proof.  For
example if some environmental condition reduced the utility of the noise-based
source, the PRNG would still provide strong input.  If the PRNG locked up for
some reason, the secret seed for that combined with the counter would still
provide varying input to the SHA-1 step.  I assume they also sampled the
output as per FIPS 140 to detect a lockup of the SHA-1 step.  The result was a
failure-tolerant design that didn't rely on the totally failure-proof
operation of a single component in order to function.

[0] I'm calling it a &quot;sound engineering approach&quot; because I did the same thing
    in my PRNG design (independent of Fortezza).  Others may wish to call it
    &quot;excessively paranoid&quot; and other things :-).
