They can't be as &quot;anonymous as cash&quot; if the party being dealt with can
be identified.  And the party can be identified if the transaction is
&quot;online, real-time&quot;.  Even if other clues are erased, there's still
traffic analysis in this case.

What the offline paradigm has going for it is the possibility of true,
untraceable anonymity through the use of anonymizing remailers and
related technologies.
