Trust is indeed expressed by relationships. And those relationships 
can be transmitted with proper consideration -- just not in your 
example. In the case of SSL certs, a simple file copy is enough.

Addendum:

Did you have a chance yet to read Kelly's paper? In that paper, he is 
looking for stuff that can't be copied -- because he hopes that such 
stuff is scarce and valuable. &quot;When copies are free, you need to sell 
things which can not be copied.&quot;

Kelly says that we can't copy trust. So, if I have 100 servers for the 
domain example.com does this mean that I have to buy 100 trusted SSL 
certs from the CA? Or, is any copy of the SSL cert as trustworthy as 
the original?
