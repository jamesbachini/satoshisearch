Usually when doing a demo of this attack, people change their minds
quickly. I'm pleased to hear that in actual use cases you acknowledge an

While riding the BART this morning, I ran into Nate Lawson (from
Cryptography Research). He mentioned that he felt people would reply
with such endorsements. I'd like to take the time to disagree with
endorsing hardware products as a solution. Hardware solutions are going
to be hard to attack in some circumstances. But they may in fact be
worse without fully viewable (or Free) source software (for the
firmware, the FPGA or the layout of the ASIC, etc.

A great example of some so called &quot;unbreakable&quot; hardware disk crypto is
this snakeoil:
<A HREF="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/19/0213237">http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/19/0213237</A>
<A HREF="http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Enclosed-but-not-encrypted--/features/110136">http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Enclosed-but-not-encrypted--/features/110136</A>

&quot;A new generation of inexpensive disk drive enclosures using hardware
encryption and RFID keys do not fulfil the promises of their publicity.
The adverts claim 128-bit AES hardware encryption, but they don't tell
us how it is used.&quot;

Without transparency, I'd rather stick with software. It has issues, we
now know about another one.
