Detailed analysis of the Storm network, how it works, its size, etc is
being activly worked on by several research groups.  Storm is nowhere near
50 million nodes and never was.

I will be presenting /some/ of this work at Toorcon in San Diego this
Saturday:

The presentation is not academic paper quality and takes more of a
code-monkey approach to the network.  Real (sane and substantiated)
numbers, stats, and graphs will be presented.  To the best of my knowledge,
it will be the first publicly released estimates of the size of the network
with actual supporting data and evidence.
