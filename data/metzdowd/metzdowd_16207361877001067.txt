With the disclaimer that I think I understand the attack but might 
nevertheless have misunderstood something:

A5/1 is difficult for this attack to apply to because of the 
clock-controlled shift registers (Adi said this).

A5/3 and the current WCDMA f8/f9 is based on Kasumi, and I'd be 
surprised if the attack applys. Ditto for the AES based CDMA security.

The soon-to-be-adopted spare WCDMA algorithm, SNOW-3G, may be vulnerable 
if used in other ways, but appears to me to be secure in the way it is 
used in 3G phones. Again, somewhat lucky though, the attack comes very 
close to working. I believe the appropriate standards committee is going 
to go off and check this very closely (I spoke to one of the members).

Greg.
