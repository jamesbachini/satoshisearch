</I>The basic details seem to be that data in flight gets protected by
splitting the message, encrypting each half protected by a different
RSA key, and sending each half along a different route using source
routing.

This means that if an attacker gets the stream on one route, they
cannot get the message even if they have one private key (or both
private keys but that never seems to get mentioned in the docs). This
is where &quot;breach proof&quot; comes from.
