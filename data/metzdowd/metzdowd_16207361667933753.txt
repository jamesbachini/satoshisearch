</I>&gt;<i> As you wrote in your blog, &quot;users really need to read those boring

</I>&gt;<i> ISP service terms grant the disclosure right on the basis of

</I>&gt;<i> term as defined /by the ISP/. Management access to the account

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Frequently, &quot;common sense&quot; and &quot;standard use&quot; are used to
</I>&gt;<i> justify such access but, technically, no justification is
</I>&gt;<i> actually needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Further, when an ISP such as google says &quot;Google does not share
</I>&gt;<i> or reveal email content or personal information with third
</I>&gt;<i> parties.&quot; one usually forgets that (1) third parties may actually

You're confusing two concepts.  &quot;Warrants&quot; apply to government
behavior; terming something a &quot;wireless wiretap&quot; carries the clear
implication of government action.  Private action may or may not
violate the wiretap act or the Stored Communications Act, but it has
nothing to do with warrants.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Councilman's case and his lawyer's declaration that &quot;Congress
</I>&gt;<i> recognized that any time you store communication, there is an
</I>&gt;<i> inherent loss of privacy&quot; was not in your blog, though. Did I
</I>&gt;<i> miss something?
</I>
Since the Councilman case took place several years before I started my
blog, it's hardly surprising that I didn't blog on it.  And it turns out
that Councilman -- see <A HREF="http://epic.org/privacy/councilman/">http://epic.org/privacy/councilman/</A> for a
summary -- isn't very interesting any more.  The original district
court ruling, upheld by three judges of the Court of Appeals,
significantly weakened privacy protections for email.  It was indeed an
important and controversial ruling.  However, case was reheard en banc;
the full court ruled that the earlier decisions were incorrect, which
left previous interpretations of the wiretap law intact.  As far as I
can tell, it was never appealed to the Supreme Court.  (The ultimate
outcome, which isn't very interesting to this list, is discussed in
<A HREF="http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/ponsor/pdf/councilman%20mo.pdf">http://pacer.mad.uscourts.gov/dc/opinions/ponsor/pdf/councilman%20mo.pdf</A>)

You are, of course, quite correct that ISP terms of service need to be
read carefully.
