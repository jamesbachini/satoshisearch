True, but the propensity of large teams of experts to issue horribly 
flawed protocols, and for the flaws in those protocols to go 
undiscovered for many years, despite the fact that once discovered they 
look glaringly obvious in retrospect, indicates that this problem, 
though not provably always hard, is in practice quite hard.
