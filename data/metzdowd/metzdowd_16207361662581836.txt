However, we do know that &quot;criminals&quot; are not always lazy. The 
trite comment often said is that if they used the same level of 
effort in a legal enterprise they would have done quite well.

The other proof that they are not lazy is looking at the 
evolution of the sophistication of malware like Storm and 
Nugache. It takes some serious effort to overcome the real 
handicaps that you point out as well as the ratio of the power 
and numbers that are hunting to put them out of business to their 
own numbers.

In many ways it is similar to a guerrilla war where many of the 
advantages are actually held by the tiny band of insurgents, who, 
greatly outnumbered and out-gunned, can in fact change history. 
The Swiss know this and train their military based on this.

Do not be surprised if the dissidents of all stripes use 
improvisation based on malware and other tools like onion routing 
to further their causes and evade suppression.

BTW, while I do not think all dissidents are righteous or 
fighting for righteous causes this does negate the general idea. 
A hammer is a hammer. Good or evil is independent of the tools, 
it depends on what one is pounding, nails or heads.

Best,

Allen
