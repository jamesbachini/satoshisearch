Thanks for the pointer. Very interesting and it proves that I 
don't have the horsepower at this point. (Just wait until I build 
that Microwulf! With the new quad core chips I should hit about 
50 GigaFLOPS. And cheeep - less than 4K)

But my real point is that CRC32 while has only 2^16 
possibilities, even SHA 1 with its degraded state has (IIRC) 2^55 
and if we go to SHA 256 it has 2^256 possibilities.

Since MD5 and SHA 256 use two different algorithms the odds of 
creating a double collision are tiny at this point.

So take your enhanced Tripwire like program and have it compute 
two different hashes. Yes, you can create a collision in the MD5, 
but can you also create a simultaneous collision in the SHA 256?

This is my point.

Best,

Allen
