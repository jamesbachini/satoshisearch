What I meant was that the crypogram decrypted with a correct f(I)=1 key
yields the encrypted message &quot;Meet you at Starbucks at noon 0000000000000&quot;
whereas decryption with a wrong, f(I)=0, key yields &quot;Let's go down to Taco
Bell at midnight&quot;.  Padding with 0's doesn't help.

Cheers, Scott

This is actually pretty easy to do by, e.g., padding all valid messages with
sufficiently-many 0s. Decryption with an incorrect key will result in
something &quot;random&quot; that is unlikely to end with the requisite number of 0s
(and so will be discarded).
