If I show up at a store and pay cash for something every week, they
can still do traffic analysis on me (&quot;oh him, he's a regular
customer&quot;) unless I go out of my way to obscure my routine like asking
other people to buy stuff for me.

It's not clear to me what the object of this argument is.  Yes, the
harder you work, the more difficult you can make it for other people
to tie your transactions to you.  This shouldn't be news to anyone.
