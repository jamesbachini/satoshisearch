Actually, PGP/MIME uses the same high-level mechanism to wrap MIME
objects as S/MIME does: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1847.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1847.txt</A>

The PGP/MIME description is in: <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3156.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3156.txt</A>

Specification wise both should work equally well, but implementation
quality may differ.

What is often overlooked is that the e-mail envelope (including the
Subject: header field) is not protected or even encrypted under RFC 3156
unless you forward the entire e-mail as a message/rfc822 MIME part
within the PGP/MIME (or S/MIME) message.  Interoperability of that has
historically been poor, but the more modern MUAs should handle it today.

Writing a .forward proxy that wraps incoming e-mails into PGP/MIME
encrypted message/rfc822 attachments should be simple, probably simpler
than PGP/MIME wrapping all the individual MIME parts in the incoming
e-mail.
