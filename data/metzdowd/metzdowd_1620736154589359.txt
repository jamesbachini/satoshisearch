<PRE>I always understood snake oil crypto to refer to products that were of
no value to anyone, e.g., products that claim to have secret
unbreakable encryption, million bit keys, or &quot;one time pads&quot; produced
by PRNGs.

What we have here is something else, a product that is reasonable for
one kind of threat, physically losing it, oversold for a threat where
it's not, end to end security.

Seems to me that we need a different term for this category.  Of
course, given the nature of marketing departments, it may well
apply to all crypto products.
