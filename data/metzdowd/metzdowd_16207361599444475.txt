I am only quarreling with the word &quot;scam.&quot;

Yes, I have. They have their with Java option and their without Java  
option, and even the &quot;Express&quot; option. Look at:

&lt;<A HREF="https://www.hushmail.com/hushmail/showHelpFile.php?">https://www.hushmail.com/hushmail/showHelpFile.php?</A> 
file=compatibility/java/index.html&gt;

which has a very nice description of each system, and what  
vulnerabilities there are with each. There are many things one might  
say about the without Java option. They might include, &quot;doesn't meet  
my security needs&quot; or &quot;I can't imagine what would possess someone to  
use the non-Java version.&quot; But it's not a scam.
