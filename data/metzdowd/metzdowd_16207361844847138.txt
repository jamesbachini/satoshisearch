Well, he does seem to credit quite a few people and companies on his own 
blog entry about the matter: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1162">http://www.doxpara.com/?p=1162</A>&gt;

It does seem he would like an air of some mystery to exist though until 
he makes his presentation about the issue at Defcon - did he, himself, 
discover something new? We'll just have to wait, unless we go play with 
the BIND code ourselves.
