You're painting with too broad a brush.  Creating artificial life failed; 
security just fails to get adopted.

Authentication is exactly what I need in the case of spam/phishing: did that 
really come from my bank?  Did it come from someone I've interacted with 
before?  Some people sign their messages automatically, some people's mail 
readers automatically check.  It works great for those who put in the effort.

And you gave examples of OS techniques which mitigate risks in buggy apps. 
Privilege escalation makes bad malware into horrible malware.

So good OS and crypto are important, and we've done good work in learning how 
to build them correctly.  You're right that they've failed in the marketplace, 
but economics and psychology were the motivating factors.  We just need to 
send our grad students over to those departments to figure out how to overcome 
those hurdles.
