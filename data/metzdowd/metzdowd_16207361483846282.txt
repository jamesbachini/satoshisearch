Correct, I was.

&gt;<i>   However given how

</I>&gt;<i>(those things are, in order &quot;some application or script&quot;, &quot;the cert trust

Very good point.

Bigger picture takeaway: when both a user and an application can 
change a crypto setting in an application (or OS), any later messages 
relating to that event are likely to be confusing because they can't 
be directly linked to the action. This applies to all of our 
crypto-in-the-real-world, not just the trust anchor issue at hand.
