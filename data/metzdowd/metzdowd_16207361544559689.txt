<PRE>to some degree, Schneier is already doing this with his &quot;doghouse&quot; section of 
the Crypto-gram newsletter. Although it sounds like you're being more 
ambitious in terms of desiring to publish cracks/hacks or whatever.

Perhaps thumbing through the various Doghouses would provide some reasonable 
targets for a more thorough inspection than what Bruce has often done? They 
are typically companies and that would certainly fit with the view of some of 
the other comentors on this thread.
