Yes it does. I'm a Wells Fargo customer and I had to set my &quot;security 
questions&quot; yesterday in order to keep using their online banking system. 
The resulting email notification said in part:

&quot;Thank you for taking the time to set up your security questions. If we 
ever need to confirm your identity, your ability to give the correct 
answers to these questions will help us verify it's you.&quot;
