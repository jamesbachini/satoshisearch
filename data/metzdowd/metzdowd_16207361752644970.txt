This would certainly cause problems in if &quot;particular mode&quot; == OFB or
counter, since (if you also reuse the IVs), you could have E(zA) == A.

If you use a different (independent, unrelated) key/IV, then the
existence of a weakness in this scheme would seem to provide evidence
of an attack on AES, regardless of mode choice.
