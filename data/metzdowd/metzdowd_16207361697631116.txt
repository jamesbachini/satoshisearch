  The next problem, though, is that the message asks people to log in by
  clicking a link in the message:

  Go to Amtrak.com now and update your profile
  <A HREF="http://amtrak.bfi0.com/.....">http://amtrak.bfi0.com/.....</A>

It's not just Amtrak that do that, CapitalOne also send out phishing email
directing users to bfi0.com.

Lesson for phishers: If you want your phish to seem more legit, outsource it
to Bigfoot Interactive, which seems to lead back to Epsilon Agency Services,
who specialise in... well, phishing, but for the good guys.  I bet the Russian
Business Network could do it for less though :-).
