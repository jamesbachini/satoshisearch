Banks are the larger and more informed party.  They need to 
provide systems that are reasonable given the situation 
(anglo courts generally take this line, when pushed, I'm 
unsure what continental courts would do with that logic). 
Customers aren't in any position to dictate security 
requirements to banks.

Unfortunately for the banks, there is a vast body of 
evidence that we knew and they knew or should have known 
that the PC was insecure [1].  So, by fielding a system -- 
online commerce -- with a known weakness, they took 
responsibility for the fraud (from all places).

Now they are in the dilemma.  The customer can't provide 
evidence of the fraud, because the system fielded doesn't 
support it (it's login authentication not transaction 
authorisation).  The NZ response above is simply not facing 
up to the facts, it is trying to create an easy way out that 
(again) shifts the liability to the customer.

They now face the question of whether to roll-back online 
access or to upgrade with some form of dual-channel 
authorisation [2].

[1] To my knowledge, continental banks knew of the risks and 
acted in the 90s, then scaled it down because the risks 
proved overstated.  Brit banks knew of the risks and didn't 
care.  American banks didn't care.

[2] Again, continental banks are shifting to SMS 
authorisation (dual-channel) ... Brit banks are unsure what 
to do ... American banks apparently don't care.
