<PRE>Student hacker exposes Carleton U cash, ID card security holes

<A HREF="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/09/08/ot-security-080908.html">http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/09/08/ot-security-080908.html</A>

&quot;A Carleton University student has revealed that he stole data containing
e-mail passwords, financial data and library account information from 32
students at the university in order to expose security holes in the system.

The card's design for both financial and identification purposes and its
&quot;inadequate safeguards against information leakage&quot; could lead to identity or
financial fraud, said the 20-year-old student of the Ottawa university in a
document e-mailed to the victims Sunday evening under the alias Kasper
Holmberg.&quot;

...

There's a few inconsistencies in this story, first claiming that this student
is from one university in Ottawa, Ontario, then the other, except that Ottawa
University is in Ottawa, Kansas while the University of Ottawa is in Ottawa,
Ontario.  CBC should have been able to get those mundane details right so who
knows about the other details...

As usual, the institution involved missed the point...
