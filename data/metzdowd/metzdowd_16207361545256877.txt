&gt;<i>   The first review I read didn't make it clear, but browsing the
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturer's website and glossy pdfs suggests that there is indeed only a
</I>&gt;<i> single USB connector - but there's an ethernet connector too.  You use it as
</I>&gt;<i> an inline device and leave your normal ethernet NIC unplugged.  
</I>
The models in the shape of a USB stick haven't got a USB connector, at
least according to the spec sheet.

&gt;<i> This is what they refer to as &quot;wired&quot; operating mode, and given
</I>&gt;<i> Steven's proviso about controlling the firmware (and let's hope
</I>&gt;<i> there's no holes or overflows in the web admin interface either...)
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this mode could just about be made secure.
</I>
Some malware queues captured data and transmits it when a network
connection is available again.
