I agree with all the above, including deleted.

To jump up and down ... if that was the solution, it would 
have been done by now :)

I would instead state that the solution was whatever Skype 
and SSH did.  And the opposite of whatever IPSec, SSL, 
Clipper, S/MIME, DRM, and all the other failures did.

HCI was one of the things, but others were as important: 
lack of open critique, service-before-security, 
crypto-for-free, total solution, narrow problem, etc.
