I seriously doubt that even a single digit percentage of end users out 
on the internet know anything about the different types of certificates 
used in SSL/TLS and what they mean.   I know none of my family (other 
than my wife: but given she worked for a large CA doing authentication 
and verification) knows what SSL really means never mind what the 
different types of cert are supposed to indicate and what to do about 
them, yet they buy stuff on the internet.  It doesn't mean they are 
ignorant it is just the normal case.

Even if you got the UI to do &quot;the right thing&quot; it still doesn't mean 
anything real about trust all it really means is how much money was 
invested in getting the cert and setting up the &quot;correct&quot; information 
about the &quot;company identity&quot; behind it.
