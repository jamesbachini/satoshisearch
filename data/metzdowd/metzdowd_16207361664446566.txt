There is an interesting analogue in the area of SAR 
(suspicious activity report) filings through financial 
services.  This has been in place with various providers for 
maybe a decade or so.  I'm not aware of any serious economic 
analysis that would suggest copying the lessons, though.

There is a philosophical problem with suggesting an 
automated protocol method for reporting fraud, in that one 
might be better off ... fixing the underlying fraud.
