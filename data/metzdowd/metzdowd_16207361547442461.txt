And you might get better results from cheaper ram which may fail more 
often.  (Adding a different sort of randomness.)

I have a friend who is a hardware engineer who is preparing a talk on just 
this sort of issue with the state of DRAM chips.  It will be interesting 
to see what he says.  (For those people in Portland, OR, it will be given 
at the PLUG Advanced Topics meeting sometime early next year.)
