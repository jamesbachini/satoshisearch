Of course, there are many tests for goodness of fit (Kolmogorov-
Smirnov, chi-square, etc.) and also you can calculate for a given
number of tests how many tests should have p-value below the
significance level. And after making hundred tests you ask yourself
what you gonna do once your test gives &quot;good uniformity&quot;, say p-value
is 0.23, but the proportion is 0.95, while the minimum pass rate for
1% is 0.96.

Only a bad statistician cannot justify any predefined answer :-)
