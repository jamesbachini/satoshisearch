Hi gang,

I have a question about all this. There seems to be a disconnect 
between the approximate prices mentioned here - too cheap to only 
do small transactions, etc - and what I have seen when looking at 
various of the sites. Maybe I'm missing something and you could 
correct my thinking.

At <A HREF="http://www.voy.com/211320/">http://www.voy.com/211320/</A> I see figures that appear to be for 
  a single card and I would not call them &quot;cheap.&quot; This one from 
the first of the month seems typical:

The cheapest price here is $10, I assume this is per card, correct?

If that is correct, what I see typically is that the order has to 
be a minimum of $500 if the money is sent Western Union. This 
means 50 cards at most. Most of the stuff I've seen is that they 
&quot;validate&quot; but do not guarantee the cards and don't give refunds.

It would seem to me that one would have to have a fair size 
infrastructure and capital to make this work as it almost certain 
that some of the cards will fail. Plus it takes people time to 
call the issuer and go through the process of changing the 
mailing address as well attempting to increase the limit line of 
credit available. This would mean that from the time of purchase 
of the card it might be a week or more before they know that the 
new limit has been approved.

This ties up capital so one wouldn't think the crooks would do 
one dump, scam all they can then start the process over again, 
but rather have a continuous stream working so they have cash flow.

So are we really talking mostly about bigger operations than the 
local operator one sees mentioned in the paper from time to time?

Thanks,

Allen
