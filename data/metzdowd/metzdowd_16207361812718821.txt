  According to this entry at viruslist.com:
<A HREF="http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?virusid=313444">http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?virusid=313444</A>
which I found linked from the analyst's diary blog, 

&quot;The virus uses Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0 (built into
Windows) to encrypt files. Files are encrypted using the RC4 algorithm. The
encryption key is then encrypted using an RSA public key 1024 bits in length
which is in the body of the virus.&quot;

  According to this thread on the gpcode forum:
<A HREF="http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?s=49bd69fb414610c700170b115d0730fa&amp;show">http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?s=49bd69fb414610c700170b115d0730fa&amp;show</A>

the readme.txt files containing the ransom key are identical in every
directory on the infected computer, suggesting that there is indeed a unique
per-host RC4 key.

  According to 
<A HREF="http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?s=72050db4cb7d54c17e3b6b134d060269&amp;show">http://forum.kaspersky.com/index.php?s=72050db4cb7d54c17e3b6b134d060269&amp;show</A>

every file encrypted by the virus grows by 8 bytes, so it looks like it uses
an IV.  But that didn't help with WEP...
