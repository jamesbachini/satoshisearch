The short answer is no, nobody knows a secure algorithm that would 
&quot;work&quot; as a decimal stream cipher AND would not extend the message size 
for some form of key material reference data (or salt or IV ...).

If you have room for such message-specific reference data, it should be 
easy to design a decimal stream cipher for short messages.
