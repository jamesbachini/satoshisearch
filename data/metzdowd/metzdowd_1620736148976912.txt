It depends on what you mean by &quot;user&quot;.  You're assuming that direct action by
the wetware behind the keyboard resulted in its removal.  However given how
obscure and well-hidden this capability is, it's more likely that a user agent
acting with the user's rights caused the problem.  So the message you end up
communicating to the user is:

   &quot;Something you've never heard of before has changed a setting you've never
   heard of before that affects the operation of something you've never heard
   of before and probably wouldn't understand no matter how patiently we
   explain it&quot;.

(those things are, in order &quot;some application or script&quot;, &quot;the cert trust
setting&quot;, &quot;certificates&quot;, and &quot;PKI&quot;).

I guess we'd need word from MS on whether this is by design or by accident,
but I can well see that quietly unbreaking something that's broken for some
reason would be seen as desirable behaviour.
