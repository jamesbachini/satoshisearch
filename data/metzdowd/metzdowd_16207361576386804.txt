I don't believe this to be the case.

FIPS 140(-2) is about validating cryptographic implementations. It is 
not about certifying entire products that contain ample functionality 
well outside the scope of cryptographic evaluation. That's more of a 
Common Criteria thing.

That said, one problem with selling FIPSed products to USG is that 
some auditors are sticklers for version numbers. They can require 
proof/rep&amp;warrant that the FIPSed version of the crypto is actually 
in use.

Audit appeasement requirements frequently cause considerable 
annoyance to both vendors and the end user.

OpenSSL FIPS Object Module 1.1.1 has FIPS 140-2 when running on SUSE 
9.0 and HPUX 11i, according to

In the context of a conversation about whether something formally has 
FIPS validation or not, the details are important.

Back to the original question...

As far as I recall, none such were submitted for consideration. Bear 
in mind that the process isn't just about software, but that a 
commercial entity submits both a product that meets the list of 
capability checkboxes, and that the entity itself is viable and can 
provide support and the like.
