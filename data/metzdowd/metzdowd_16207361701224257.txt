I think that the market is a little bit bigger than just applications 
running Monte Carlo simulations.
For example, Gambling industry - which is also multi-billion industry 
world-wide.

Since this news have been discussed in this cryptographic mailing 
list, I would be interested when
some of the cryptographers test this device too. The device produces 
stream of random bits with a
speed of 2Mbps, but in the article there is nothing about the 
cryptographic strength of the produced
stream. It can produce statistically qualitative uniform random bits, 
but still to be cryptographically
weak.
