Yes. Usability should be the #1 property of a secure system.

Conventional security thinking says that usability and security are 
like a seesaw; if usability goes up, security must go down, and 
vice-versa. This apparent antinomy actually works as a synergy: with 
more usability in a secure system, security increases. With less 
usability in a secure system, security decreases. A secure system that 
is not usable will be left aside by users.

Cheers,
