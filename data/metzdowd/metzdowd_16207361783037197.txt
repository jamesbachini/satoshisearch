</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I am left with the strong suspicion that SSL VPNs are &quot;easier to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; population simply is not very sensitive to how much security is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually provided.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; They're &quot;easier to configure and use&quot; because most users don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; want to have to rebuild their entire world around PKI just to set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; up a tunnel from A to B.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm one of those people who uses OpenVPN instead of IPSEC, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one of the people who helped create IPSEC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Right now, to use SSH to remotely connect to a machine using public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; keys, all I have to do is type &quot;ssh-keygen&quot; and copy the locally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; generated public key to a remote machine's authorized keys file.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When there is an IPSEC system that is equally easy to use I'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; switch to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Until then, OpenVPN let me get started in about five minutes, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the fact that it is less than completely secure doesn't matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; much to me as I'm running SSH under it anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's a technical/philosophical issue lurking here.  We tried to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solve it in IPsec; not only do I think we didn't succeed, I'm not at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all clear we could or should have succeeded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IPsec operates at layer 3, where there are (generally) no user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contexts.  This makes it difficult to bind IPsec credentials to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user, which means that it inherently can't be as simple to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configure as ssh.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Put another way, when you tell an sshd whom you wish to log in as,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it consults that user's home directory and finds an authorized_keys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; file. How can IPsec -- or rather, any key management daemon for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IPsec -- do that?  Per-user SPDs?  Is this packet for port 80 for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user pat or user chris?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can envision ways around this (especially if we have an IP address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per user of a system -- I've been writing about fine-grained IP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address assignment for years), but they're inherently a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex than ssh.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ssh server determines who the packets are for from information
</I>&gt;<i> sent to it by the ssh client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ssh client knows on whose behalf it is acting by virtue of being 
</I>&gt;<i> invoked by that user (I'll admit this is a simplification of the most 
</I>&gt;<i> general case, but I assert my argument is unaffected), and thus is
</I>&gt;<i> able to include the information when it talks to the server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly, the client end of an IPSEC connection knows who opened the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection and could, similarly, convey that information. That data
</I>&gt;<i> may not be available in some OSes by the time it gets to the IPSEC
</I>&gt;<i> stack, but that's a deficiency of the OS, not a fundamental problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>The problem is more on the server end.
