This isn't a good design. It's incompatible with Tahoe's present  
architecture, introduces a single point of failure, centralizes the  
otherwise by-design decentralized filesystem, and presents a simple  
way to mount denial of service attacks. Finally, since the  
decentralization in Tahoe is part of its security design (storage  
servers aren't trusted), you run into the usual quis custodiet ipsos  
custodes problem with the ticket-issuing server that the present  
system nicely avoids.

Cheers,
