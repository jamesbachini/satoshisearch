<PRE>A proposal for a new password hashing based on SHA-256 or SHA-512 has  
been proposed by RedHat but to my knowledge has not had any rigorous  
analysis. The motivation for this is to replace MD-5 based password  
hashing at banks where MD-5 is on the list of &quot;do not use&quot; algorithms.  
I would prefer not to have the discussion &quot;MD-5 is good enough for  
this algorithm&quot; since it is not an argument that the customers  
requesting these changes are going to accept.
