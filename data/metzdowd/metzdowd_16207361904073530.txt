Not speaking for my employer here.

Most browser vendors try to display pages as best they can.  Both end
users and businesses get very upset at browser makers who push
security improvements by breaking existing practices.

If such changes were to happen, then they should either be emergency
(seems unlikely, given how long this has been around) or planned and
communicated.  Adding something high impact after beta 2 doesn't seem
like good communication.

What makes now the perfect time to address an issue which has been
present for quite soem time?
