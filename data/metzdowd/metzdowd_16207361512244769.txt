Sure, absolutely, that's why I made the LINPACK comment at the end.  However
for the sorts of usages that malware authors might put it to (e.g. A5 rainbow
tables, as Daniel Schroeder suggested) it's probably going to be hard to beat.
The message was intended to draw attention to the frightening amount of raw
computing power that's now in the hands of people whose identities and motives
we're not even certain of.
