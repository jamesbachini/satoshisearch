<PRE>|<i> &gt;All of this ignores a significant issue:  Are keying and encryption

</I>I don't know.  Can you prove that your way of looking at it is valid?
After all, I can look at encryption as applying a PRF to a data
stream, and authentication as computing a keyed one-way function (or
something) - so is there anything to prove about whether I can choose
and combine them independently?  About whether Encrypt-then-MAC and
MAC-then-Encrypt are equivalent?

I should think by now that we've learned how delicate our cryptographic
primitives can be - and how difficult it can be to compose them in a
way that retains all their individual guarantees.
