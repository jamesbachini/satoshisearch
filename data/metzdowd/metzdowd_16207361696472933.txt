Encrypting blocks only when they are used can be risky in terms of false 
sense of security. There is basically no way for you to tell what is 
left out there.

Encrypting the drive while the system is live is what TC currently does. 
Encryption runs in the background while you can do other things (though 
much slower).

Hagai.
