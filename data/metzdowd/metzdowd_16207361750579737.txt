<PRE>There are high assurance systems that exist that do eactly this. There
are two different implementations of the security unit processing the
same data. The outputs are compared by a seperate high assurance and
validated module that enters into an alarm mode should the outputs
differ.

However, these are generally costly affairs, you need to pay two
implementation teams etc, therefore remain the luxury of only the most
critical systems.


For hardware, this
&gt;<i> would mean running multiple chips in parallel checking each others
</I>&gt;<i> states/outputs.  Architectures like that have been built for
</I>&gt;<i> reliability (e.g., Stratus), but generally they assume identical
</I>&gt;<i> processors.  Whether you can actually build such a thing with
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately different processors is an open question.
