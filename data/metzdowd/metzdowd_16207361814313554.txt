Encryption doesn't necessarily provide integrity.

Consider the case of a stream cipher like RC4, where you have
a function RC4(K) which generates a string of bytes from the
key K.

The encryption function is then:

Ciphertext[i] = RC4(K)[i] XOR Plaintext[i]


It should be apparent that an attacker can make targeted
modifications to the plaintext. Say he knows that plaintext
byte i is 'A' and he wants it to be 'B', he just changed
Ciphertext[i]' = Ciphertext[i] XOR 'A' XOR 'B'. Mission
accomplished.
