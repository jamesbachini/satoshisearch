Wander over to <A HREF="http://keylength.com/">http://keylength.com/</A> and poke at their 
models.  They have 6 or so to choose from, and they have it 
coded up in the webapplication so you can get the 
appropriate comparisons.

Each model is reasonably well-founded (some work was put in 
by somebody who knows something) and they've been doing it 
for a few years now.
