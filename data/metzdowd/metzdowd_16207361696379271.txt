Depending on the lifetime of the keys involved, you can probably  
truncate the MAC tags much more than this.  Using the RTP counter for  
use in some appropriate stateful MAC may mean a 3- or 4-byte tag is  
enough security.  Additionally, in order to conserve bandwidth you  
might want to make a trade-off where some packets may be forged with  
small probability (in the VOIP case, that means an attacker gets to  
select a fraction of a second of sound, which is probably harmless),  
but it is hard to forge many packets.

In (<A HREF="http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/095">http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/095</A>), John Black and I treat this  
model in depth, and suggest a MAC scheme which may be most appropriate  
for this scenario.  A stateful, highly-truncated HMAC will also work  
fine, but is slower than the scheme we propose.
