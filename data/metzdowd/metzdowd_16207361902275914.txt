This is a ridiculous set of objections.

First, modern operating systems have tools so that users don't have to
manually build or &quot;load up&quot; various packages, they just cleanly
install.  My non-computer literate relatives manage to install the
flash plugin for their browsers without assistance -- this is clearly
not an issue any longer.

Second, if your new version of thunderbird doesn't work with some old
plugin, don't upgrade until it does! Rollback is pretty easy on
Windows, OS X, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc. Not that this will happen in
practice if the plugin is popular.
