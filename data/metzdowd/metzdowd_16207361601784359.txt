Seconded. the java applet is effectively a mail client, a copy of gpg, 
and a copy of the secret keyring; the public keys are looked up on the 
server though, and I suspect/assume that the messages are no more or 
less secure at the hushmail side than your own pgp mail would be on a 
isp imap server (i.e., you could get traffic information trivially just 
by looking, but message content would require being lucky with the 
keyphrase or active co-operation from hushmail to give you a &quot;gimmicked&quot; 
client the next time you log in that reveals that information.
