Is $7.59 cheap enough?

For that you get a USB audio adapter with mike jack, and
then you can run turbid(tm) to produce high-quality randomness.

Reference, including analytical paper plus code:

If the above is not good enough, please explain.

I think the turbid solution is much better than a disk.
 -- Unlimited long-term capacity.
 -- Perfect forward secrecy, unlike a disk, unless you do a 
  really good job of erasing each block after use.
 -- Perfect secrecy in the other direction, period.
