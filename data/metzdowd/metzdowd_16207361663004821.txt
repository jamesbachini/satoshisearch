Yes. Caveats apply but SSL/TLS is useful and simple for this purpose.

The problem is when it is generalized from the particular case where
it helps (above) to general use, and as a solution to prevent wireless
wiretapping. For example, as in this comment from a data center/network
provider:

Now, personally, with all the publicly available info regarding
warrantless wiretapping and so on, why any private communications should
be &quot;in the clear&quot; I just don't know. Even my MTA offers up SSL or TLS to
other MTA's when advertising its capabilities. The RFC is there, use it
as they say.
