<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> (it doesn't just &quot;slow down a lot&quot;). Since /dev/random use depletes
</I>&gt;<i> the pool directly, it is imperative that wasteful reads of this
</I>&gt;<i> pseudo-device be avoided at all costs.

Yes. Still, some people are using fopen/fread to access /dev/random, which 
does pre-fetching on most implementations I saw, so using open/read is 
preferred for using /dev/random.

Implementations can be rather easily checked with strace.

Best regards,
Philipp G&#252;hring
