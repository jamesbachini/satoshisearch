</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	data points.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far, so good. This disconnect doesn't seem to have done the CA 
</I>&gt;<i> industry any harm, though.
</I>
	The CA business -is- to serve as a &quot;notary&quot; They attest to
	the binding o fthe key to holder.  To date, thats NOT what
	a zone admin does, he is attesting that its HIS key, that it
	is HIS record in HIS database.  Just because he has sold the
	right to use to someone else, is still his database and his data.

	Unless of course Nominet (for example) is now going to allow 
	client driven dynamic updates - where the clients are in complete 
	control of their data.  (thats closer to James, assertion that he 
	owns/controls his domain name)
	
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      Remember that while you may control your forward
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	name (and not many people actually run their own DNS servers)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	it is less likely that you run your address maps - and for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	the paranoid, you would want to ensure the forward and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	reverse zones are signed and at the intersection, there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	a common data element which you can use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Non sequiteur, plus I can't see why paranoia would prompt me to want to 
</I>&gt;<i> do this? What does it prove?
</I>
	The argument is, again, to James asserton that he owns his domain 
	name.  In point of fact, every node has at least two &quot;names&quot;
	in the DNS, the forward (which gets most of the attention) and the
	reverse - which is nearly always controled by your ISP.

	DNSSEC validation along one path in the DNS graph is reassuring
	(or so it is claimed).  I posit that validation over two, generally
	non-overlapping administrative spheres of influence, in the DNS
	graph would give a higher level of assurance. Couple this with
	finding the identical x509 cert at the origin of the validation
	chain for both paths - and I think I have a much higher confidence
	that I am actually going to be sending packets to the &quot;right&quot;
	node.


&gt;<i> Also, PTR records are only supposed to point to &quot;primary domain names&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Since it is common for hosts to have many names resolving to the same IP 
</I>&gt;<i> address, by definition most of these will not correspond to the reverse 
</I>&gt;<i> lookup.
</I>
	Er... Allow me the option o fdisbeleiving your assertion.
	PTR records can and do point to mutiple names.  Some narrow
	implementations have assumed that there will only be a single
	data element and this myth - that PTRs only point to a single
	name - is and has been spread widely.

&gt;<i> &gt;	To do what you want, want, you might consider using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	CERT-rr, using the DNS to distribute host-specific keys/certs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	And to ensure that the data in the DNS was not tampered with,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	using DNSSEC signed zones with CERT-rr's would not be a bad
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;	thing.   In fact, thats what we are testing .
