It's actually not that bad, we have some really good password managers that
can take care of this for us, alongside quite a bit of research from HCI
people that examine their effectiveness.  By &quot;password manager&quot; I mean one
that generates a strong password for you and supplies it as required, not the
noddy &quot;managers&quot; built into things like web browsers, look at something like
Roboform for an example of what I mean.  The problem is that I don't know of
any application that natively uses them, there are between half a dozen and a
dozen Firefox plugins and third-party apps (it varies over time) that all
provide enhanced password-handling capabilities but the browser itself still
has the incredibly clunky 1.0 &quot;manager&quot; that it's always had (not specifically
picking on FF here, all the others are just as bad, the difference is that FF
has a pile of functioning plugins and usability research that demonstrate how
to get it right).

The problem isn't with passwords, it's with developers: Passwords are insecure
because developers have chosen to make them insecure.  We have mechanisms to
address a lot of the problems with passwords but no-one ever uses them.  Even
suggesting some of these things is hard ehough, the response to &quot;What about
using security measure X which addresses problem Y&quot; isn't to use measure X but
to find some obscure corner case where X won't work, declare the problem
unsolveable, and keep on doing the same thing that already didn't work the
last 100 times we tried it.
