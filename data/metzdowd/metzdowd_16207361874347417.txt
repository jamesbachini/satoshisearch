I believe that's correct.  In fact, the plate recognition technology  
they
use seems to be good enough to make the transponder itself redundant.
I know several people with E-Z Pass who disconnected the internal
battery of their transponder (out of concern that there might be
hidden readers around town that track vehicles at places other than
toll gates).   Even with dead transponders, their accounts are still
charged accurately when they pass toll gates.  (The sign displays &quot;EZ  
Pass
not read&quot; or some such thing, but the account is debited within a day
or two anyway).
