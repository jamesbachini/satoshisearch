That MD5 is broken is of course old news.

I observe that US authorities have decided on a hash,
found it was broken, decided on a new hash, found it was
broken also, and are now where we are.

Russian authorities decided on a 256 bit hash in 1990:
GOST R 34.11-94.  It is still good as far as anyone
knows, and has never needed to be changed.

This entirely confirms my prejudices about the US
government cryptographers.
