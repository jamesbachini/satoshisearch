Just like any term, it can have many interpretations.
However, the most useful definition is the one that you can find at
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil_(cryptography">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil_(cryptography</A>) and which quite
accurately reflects what the people who first brought this term into use
used it for.
