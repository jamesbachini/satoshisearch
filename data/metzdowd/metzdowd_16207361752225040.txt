Provided you have access to enough chip diversity so as to build a 
correction channel with sufficient capacity, Shannon's Tenth Theorem 
assures you that it is possible to reduce the effect of bad chips on 
the output to an error rate /as close to zero/ as you desire. There is 
no lower, limiting value but zero.

Statistical independence is not required to be 100%. Events are not 
required to be randomly flat either. Sampling is required to  be 
independent, but also not 100%.

The counter-point is that the existence of a violation can be tested 
within a desired confidence level, which confidence level is dynamic.

The more comparison channels you have, and the more independent they 
are, the harder it is to compromise them /at the same time/.

In regard to time, one strategy is indeed to watch 100% of the time 
but for random windows of certain lengths and intervals. The duty 
ratio for a certain desired detection threshold depends on the 
correction channel total capacity, the signal dynamics, and some other 
variables. Different implementations will allow for different duty 
ratios for the same error detection capability.

&gt;<i> The paper itself describes reasonable ways to prevent detection on the

</I>&gt;<i> issues, etc, can all be patched over well enough to render the

</I>
Except as above; using a correction channel with enough capacity the 
problem can /always/ be solved (ie, with an error rate as close to 
zero as desired).

&gt;<i> Truth be told, I think there is no defense against malicious hardware

</I>
As above, the problem is solvable (existence proof provided by 
Shannon's Tenth Theorem).  It is not a matter of whether it works -- 
the solution exists; it's a matter of implementation.
