</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Now you seem to answer the question yourself: SCA protections apply to a 
single class of attacks, while there are many.

Going back to &quot;who cares&quot;, having done certification consulting 
assignments for some devices with crypto, when there was no 
checklist-based standard to apply, &quot;good practice&quot; security criteria (to 
be briefly documented in the report) would include the following questions:

(A) Is the secret key inside a device unit applicable to this single 
unit, or is it a system-wide, or domain-wide key?

That's a key management scheme question.

(B) Is the attack destructive? Which device unit features (especially 
&quot;be in working order&quot;, but also &quot;be absent of actual tampering evidence&quot; 
or even &quot;remain under the control of the legitimate user without 
interruptions longer than X&quot; ) need to be impaired for a given class of 
attack to succeed? This question pertains to the secret key as in (A) 
and also to any public-key-to-be-integrity-protected which would prevent 
malicious code download.

That's a product design question.

(C) What are the incentives, if any, for the legitimate user to remain 
well-behaved in the human aspects of device protection? (E.g. a merchant 
has some incentive to maintain a payment authorization device in good 
working order.) This leads to the question of insider threats, so 
satisfactory answers in this area are seldom present.

This is an application design question.

This gives an idea of analyses that drives security-related spendings 
(in my limited experience). Clients (intend to) pay for protections that 
will prevent financial losses and major public relations impacts (and 
then cut operating budgets soon after the project gets its 
authorization!). The consultant study must clearly link attackers' 
motivations to impacts and to countermeasures.

Refinements to the above analysis methodology call for the same creative 
mind that you assume from the part of the attackers. E.g. the usefulness 
of a device unit clone for the attacker should be considered for 
questions (B) and (C).

Does SCA protection enter the picture? Marginally at best.
