Why enter your mother's actual maiden name when prompted for it? A
security savvy user will recognize this as a second password, that
multiple sites seem to want to share, and enter something unique and
unmemorable (stored on a &quot;keychain&quot; or just discarded if the primary
password is similarly safely stored).

When asked to provide answers for security questions, mine are always
either the output of &quot;openssl rand -base64 N&quot; (with N = 6, 9 or 12),
or more memorable non-sequiturs when that is more appropriate. Here's
a new reasonably memorable variant.
