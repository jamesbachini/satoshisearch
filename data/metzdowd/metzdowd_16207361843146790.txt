One thing about drive-based encryption is that we're been proised this since 
about 2000 or 2001, and it's always just another year or two away for various 
reasons: standardisation, host controller support, OS support, phase of the 
moon, ... .  The current reason seems to be FIPS 140: the turnaround time for 
a FIPS 140 eval is significantly longer than the mean lifetime of any 
particular hardware/firmware config, and the cost of the constant re-evals 
doesn't help much either.  So drive-based FDE is currently awaiting the 
loading of a compliment of small FIPS 140-soaked paper napkins.  Until then 
there will be a short delay.  Please return to your seats.
