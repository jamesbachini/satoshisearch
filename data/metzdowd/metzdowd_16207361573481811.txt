At the timpe that <A HREF="http://www.vaf.sk/download/keysize.pdf">http://www.vaf.sk/download/keysize.pdf</A> was published, 
1024 bit asymmetric encryption over integers was comparable in strength 
to 80 bit symmetric encryption, and elliptic curve encryption over a 160 
bit fields.

At that time integers based asymmetric encryption took about four times 
as long to compute as the comparable strength elliptic curve asymmetric 
encryption.

Since then, integer encryption has weakened further relative to elliptic 
curve encryption, due to advances in factorization and the discrete log 
problem, increasing the advantage of elliptic curves.

With widespread failure to use encryption due to the computational costs 
a factor of more than four is not to be sneezed at.
