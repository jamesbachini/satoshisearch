<PRE>This is fairly interesting: AFAIK the first generalization of  
predicate encryption to support disjunctions. I find the result mostly  
interesting mathematically, since I expect we won't be seeing  
predicate encryption in widespread use anytime soon due to complexity  
and regulatory concerns. --IK

Abstract: Predicate encryption is a new paradigm generalizing, among  
other things, identity-based encryption. In a predicate encryption  
scheme, secret keys correspond to predicates and ciphertexts are  
associated with attributes; the secret key SK_f corresponding to the  
predicate f can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with  
attribute I if and only if f(I)=1. Constructions of such schemes are  
currently known for relatively few classes of predicates.
We construct such a scheme for predicates corresponding to the  
evaluation of inner products over N (for some large integer N). This,  
in turn, enables constructions in which predicates correspond to the  
evaluation of disjunctions, polynomials, CNF/DNF formulae, or  
threshold predicates (among others). Besides serving as what we feel  
is a significant step forward in the theory of predicate encryption,  
our results lead to a number of applications that are interesting in  
their own right.
