&gt;<i> May I ask what you're trying to accomplish? Recall that TLS doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> start until a TCP connection has been established, so there's
</I>&gt;<i> aready a proof of the round trip.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, a mechanism of this type has already been described
</I>&gt;<i> for DTLS (RFC 4347), so no new invention would be needed.

My comment was in a context of a thread discussing Obfuscated TCP.

One of the suggestions was to piggyback SSL handshake on TCP 
handshake, to which someone pointed at an issue with SYN-flood 
like DoS attacks. My response was to the latter comment.
