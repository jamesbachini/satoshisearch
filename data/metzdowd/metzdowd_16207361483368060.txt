<PRE>I think you misread what I said about &quot;BIOS jumper required install&quot;.

Ie this is not a one click install from email.  It is something one
user in 10,000 would even install at all!  It would be more like
people who program and install custom BIOSes or something, people who
reverse-engineer security products.  Point is to allow audit of
running code by a few paranoid people to keep things honest.

The whole point of the separate program space is that it DOES NOT get
infested with viruses like windows does.  The software running in it
will be very very simple, have minimal UI, minimal code etc.

Obviously there would be no software connection between anything
received in email and changing the software in the physical or virtual
software compartment.
