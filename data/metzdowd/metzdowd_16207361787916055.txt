Without taking a position on the security of open source vs. closed
source (which strikes me as an open question), I agree with Perry
that deciding whether a given piece of software has back doors is
not really possible for a nontrivial piece of software. Note that
this is a very different problem from finding a single vulnerability
or answering specific (small) questions about the code [0].

[0] That said, I don't think that determining whether a nontrivial
piece of software security vulnerabilities is difficult. The
answer is &quot;yes&quot;.
