I think it's exactly the opposite, we're already having enough problems with
microarchitectural (MA) attacks without explicit diagnostic facilities built
into the CPU.  If you look at the AMD specs these extra ring3-accessible
facilities are only going to make it worse.  These attacks are essentially
impossible to defend against merely by modifying the victim code, the only
possible defences at the moment are:

1. &quot;Don't do that then&quot; (i.e. don't allow arbitrary untrusted code to run in
   parallel with your crypto ops).

2. With future hardware support, some mechanism for partitioning the CPU so
   that critical regions of code can run without leaving externally observable
   traces, ending with some sort of super-INVD/INVLPG instruction to clear all
   caches and buffers.  So the code would be something like:

    enter_secure_region
    [[[crypto code]]]
    INV_everything
    exit_secure_region

   Of course something like this would have to be accessible from ring 3,
   which makes it a built-in DoS mechanism.

So &quot;don't do that then&quot; seems to be the only fix for this (not including the
usual blue-sky response of everyone having &lt;insert-crypto-gadget-du-jour&gt;
built into their system).
