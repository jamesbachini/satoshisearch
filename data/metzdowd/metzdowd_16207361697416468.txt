<PRE>Not just Amtrak.  The Economist and The New Yorker both do the same 
thing.  I tried engaging them in a discussion on the subject.  The 
Economist never replied, whereas the New Yorker assured me that those 
addresses were indeed theirs.  I haven't figured out how to get past the 
clueless people whose job is not to be clueful and engage the clueless 
people whose job should be to be clueful.
