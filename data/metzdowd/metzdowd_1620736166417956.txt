Actually VMMs do provide some security, but not in the way you think.  Since
malware researchers typically run malware they're analysing inside a VM, quite
a bit of malware will silently exit (or at least not exercise the &quot;mal&quot; part
of its name) if it detects that it's running inside a VM.  So you can
inoculate yourself against at least some malware by running your OS inside a
VM.
