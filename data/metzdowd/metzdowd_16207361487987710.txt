&gt;<i> Crypto has been an IP minefield for some years.  With the expiry of
</I>&gt;<i> certain patents, and the availability of other unencumbered crypto
</I>&gt;<i> primitives (eg. AES), we may see this change.  But John's other
</I>&gt;<i> points are well made, and still valid.  Downloadable MP3 ring tones
</I>&gt;<i> are a selling point.  E2E security isn't (although I've got to
</I>&gt;<i> wonder about certain teenage demographics... :)

It's also an open question whether network operators subject to
interception requirements can legally offer built-in E2E encryption
capabilities without backdoors.
