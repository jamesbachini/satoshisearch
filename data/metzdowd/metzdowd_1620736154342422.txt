<PRE>Anyone know anything about the Yoggie Pico (www.yoggie.com)?  It claims
to do much more than the Ironkey, though the language is a bit less
&quot;marketing-speak&quot;.  On the other hand, once I got through the
marketing stuff to the technical discussions at Ironkey, I ended
up with much more in the way of warm fuzzies than I do with Yoggie.
