  So by your exacting standards, PGP, gpg, openssh, in fact basically
_everything_ is snake oil.  Endpoint security is a real issue, but it's not
within the remit of this product to address.  I feel your complaint is
overblown.  Marketspeak alone doesn't make a product snakeoil, its security
has to actually be bogus too.

  No, as opposed to a *Pseudo* Random Number Generator.  This is a really
silly thing to attempt to complain about; they're correctly using technical
terminology that you should be perfectly familiar with.
