Alas, reading from /dev/urandom depletes the entropy pool much like
reading from /dev/random does.  So if you read a lot of data from
/dev/urandom, you make /dev/random unusable in practice.  This problem
has hit libgcrypt/gnutls via the MTA Exim on a lot of Debian systems.  I
would argue that the linux kernel /dev/*random system is sub-optimally
designed, reading a lot of data from /dev/urandom should not cause the
system's /dev/random to be unusable.

(Admittedly, there were other design flaws in how exim used gnutls, such
as re-generating the DH parameters every X hour, and doing that
synchronously in the SMTP process, causing them all to stall waiting for
entropy, but that has been fixed.)
