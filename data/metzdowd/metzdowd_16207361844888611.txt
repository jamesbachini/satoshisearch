<PRE>Hi,

I would suggest to use <A HREF="http://www.cacert.at/random/">http://www.cacert.at/random/</A> to test the 
randomness of the DNS source ports. Due to the large variety of 
random-number sources that have been tested there already, it's useful 
as a classification service of unknown randomly looking numbers.
You just have to collect 12 MB of numbers from a DNS server and upload 
it there. (If you get 2 Bytes per request, that's 6 million requests you 
have to do)

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see the point of evaluating the quality of a random number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generator by statistical tests.
</I>
We successfully used statistical tests to detect broken random number 
generators, we informed the vendors and they fixed them.
