<PRE>Ok thanks, I'm going to risk pedanticism in order to nail things down a bit 
more rigorously..

&gt;<i>  I'm going to approach the answer somewhat differently: Why are you using

</I>
Are you referring to the above mentioned mechanism of arriving at the ZZ value 
independently, which is implied in RFC2631?

(btw, I am not myself designing anything at this time that uses DH, I'm 
reviewing/analyzing. I am _not_ reviewing RFC2630/2631 themselves, rather it's 
a (non-IETF) spec that references 2631)


&gt;<i>  The only reason that it's present in the spec is politics,
</I>&gt;<i> it being an attempt to avoid the RSA patent.
</I>
So by &quot;the spec&quot; you're referring to RFC2631 here?

Or are you referring to X9.42?

Or something else?


&gt;<i>  Its adoption was severely
</I>&gt;<i> hampered by the fact that US vendors already had RSA licenses, non-US vendors
</I>&gt;<i> didn't care (and in any case the patent has now expired, so they care even
</I>&gt;<i> less), no CA's of note will issue X9.42 certificates, and even if they did
</I>&gt;<i> almost no S/MIME implementations support it.
</I>
&lt;snippage/&gt;

So here, and in the snippage, are you referring to X9.42 itself, or CMS 
(Cryptographic Message Syntax) ?


&gt;<i>  A few years after the expiry of the RSA patent, the matter was corrected by
</I>&gt;<i> changing the standard so that vendors were no longer required to even pretend
</I>&gt;<i> to support X9.42.  My comments at the time were:
</I>
Exactly which &quot;standard&quot; ?  From grepping all RFCs, it seems you're referring 
to CMS when you say &quot;the standard&quot;, which has indeed been revised a few times 
since RFC2630.

thanks,
