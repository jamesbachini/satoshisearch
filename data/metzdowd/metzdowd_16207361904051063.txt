The article and the study concerned user vulnerabilities compounded
by poor user interfaces and poor underlying architectures. I was  
addressing
my comments toward the study generally, and to the inappropriate but
common tone of the article, in particular, not to other out-of-band
issues. There are many risks in the world. I see in that study some  
confirmation
that poor design has made certain of those risks worse.

&gt;<i> I was having a discussion over lunch about a week ago with a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> pretty well known security people (one of them might pipe up on the
</I>&gt;<i> list). We were considering what would happen in a particular seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> foolproof system with a trusted channel if someone got a message via

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...a large fraction of users would just press &quot;YES&quot;.

Straw man.

&gt;<i> I don't want to claim that there is no place for better human factors
</I>&gt;<i> work in security engineering. There clearly is. However, I will

</I>
Considering the magnitude and frequency of losses that apparently occur
through these technologies, and the fact that the crypto and security
technologies are pretty far evolved and seem to work well if used  
well, I
would counter that human factors are just about all we should be  
worrying
about right now, if we hope to ever make online activities as safe as  
they
should be.
