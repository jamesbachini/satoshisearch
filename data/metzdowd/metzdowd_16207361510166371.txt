The case you quoted seems to apply only for punitive damages. If this is
the case then I'm afraid the impact of this ruling will be to a lesser
extent than you hope...

When you infringe a patent, its owner is likely to sue you for
compensatory damages, claiming that you caused him lack of income, loss
of customers, etc. IIUC, punitive damages generally apply only where
compensatory damages are deemed an inadequate remedy or where some
deterrence effect is required.

With or without punitive damages added to the ruling against you,
compensatory damages alone can end up being a large enough stack of cash
to discourage you from infringing a patent, as long as you suspect its
owner may actually have a case.

Regards,
Hagai.

P.S. IANAL, of course.
