And you can also find some SHA-1 hashes as well as base 64 
encoded MD5 &amp; SHA-1 hashes googling for them and the results are 
located at <A HREF="http://mina.naguib.ca/dist/digest/digest-54.txt">http://mina.naguib.ca/dist/digest/digest-54.txt</A> for 
&quot;Anthony&quot; The fun part of this is that it has alpha upper and

starting point. The list is in first letter alpha ordered.

Best,
