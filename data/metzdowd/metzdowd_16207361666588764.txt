<PRE>There was a paper in IEEE Security &amp; Privacy 2006 by Sam King on how  
to do this kind of attack (his system was called SubVirt):

However, in practice it turns out this is a much harder than people  
think. See Tal Garfinkel's paper on precisely this topic at HotOS 2007:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> some of the current trade-off is whether that virtual machine  
</I>&gt;<i> technology
</I>&gt;<i> can be used to partition off basically insecure operations (which  
</I>&gt;<i> are widely
</I>&gt;<i> recognized as being easy to compromise) and then completely discard
</I>&gt;<i> the environment and rebuild from scratch after every session (sort of
</I>&gt;<i> the automated equivalent of having to manually wipe an infected  
</I>&gt;<i> machine
</I>&gt;<i> and re-install from scratch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the counter argument is that crooks can possibly also use similar
</I>&gt;<i> technology to hide ... once they have infected the machine. the  
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> issue is that a lot of the antivirus/scanning techniques are  
</I>&gt;<i> becoming obsolete
</I>&gt;<i> w/o the attackers even leveraging virtual machine technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The attackers can leverage the technology in an otherwise poorly
</I>&gt;<i> defended machine. Some years ago there was a product claiming
</I>&gt;<i> that it could operate even at a public access machine because
</I>&gt;<i> of their completeness of their antivirus countermeasures ... even
</I>&gt;<i> on an infected machine. I raised the issue that it would be trivial
</I>&gt;<i> to defeat all such countermeasures using virtual machine technology.
</I>&gt;<i> Somewhat of a skirmish resulted since they had never considered
</I>&gt;<i> (or heard of) virtual machine technology ... for all i know there
</I>&gt;<i> is still ongoing head-in-the-sand situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> for little topic drift ... this blog entry:

</I>&gt;<i> there is some assertion that the crooks overwhelming the
</I>&gt;<i> defenders countermeasures because they are operating
</I>&gt;<i> significantly faster and more efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> however, another interpretation is that the defenders
</I>&gt;<i> have chosen extremely poor position to defend ... and are
</I>&gt;<i> therefor at enormous disadvantage. it may be necessary
</I>&gt;<i> to change the paradigm (and/or find the high ground)
</I>&gt;<i> in order to successfully defend.
