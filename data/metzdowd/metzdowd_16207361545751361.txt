That's not the threat model; the main use of FDE is to protect the data 
in a lost/stolen laptop.

FWIW, a couple of days ago I got yet another of those letters where a 
former employer is informing me that they lost my personal data; this 
time it was AT&amp;T telling me that a laptop with employee benefits on it 
got stolen.
