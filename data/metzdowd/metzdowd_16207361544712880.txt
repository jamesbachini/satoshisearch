Actually the stormworm network illustrates this example perfectly.  As with
most DHT based P2P networks, stormworm suffers from latent/stale node data
still in the memory of other nodes.  Asside from the overnet peer bootstrap
files for each stormworm node, the list of nodes in the network is
distributed in memory across all the nodes.

Stormworm is especially bad because the authors didn't take the latent
data problem into account.  There is no built-in mechanism for a botted
host to remove dead peers from their list in memory.  With tens of
thousands of nodes, IPs of machines that were infected and cleaned weeks
ago still occasionally show up.  I suspect this behavior is the primary
source of the ridiculously high (and inaccurate) estimates for the size of
the stormworm botnet.
