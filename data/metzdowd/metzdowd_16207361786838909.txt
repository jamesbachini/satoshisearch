  Well spotted.  Yes, I guess that's what Jim Youll was asking.  And I
should have said &quot;seemingly-contradictory&quot;.  This is, of course, what I
meant by &quot;marketeering&quot;: when someone asks if your service is insecure and
interceptable, you don't say &quot;Yes, our ordinary service will give you up to
the filth at the drop of a hat&quot;, you spin it as &quot;No, our enterprise service
is completely secure [...other details elided...]&quot;.


    cheers,
