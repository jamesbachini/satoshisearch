These have been around for awhile, I'm not on my home machine at the moment or
I'd post a link to a blog analysis of this sort of thing.  Although it's 
impossible to tell due to the lack of figures from either side (PKI phishing 
vs. client cert use) it may well be that there's more use of PKI to attack 
bank clients than to defend them.
