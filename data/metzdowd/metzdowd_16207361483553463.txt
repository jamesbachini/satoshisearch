<PRE>The UK Home Office have just announced that they intend to bring the 
provisions of Pt 3 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 
into force on 1st October. This is the law that enables Policemen to 
demand keys to encrypted material, on pain of imprisonment, and without 
judicial approval of these demands.

There is one last Parliamentary process to go through, the approval of a 
code of practice, but as far as I know there has never been a case of 
one of these failing to pass - though a related one was withdrawn a few 
years ago. We will try to prevent it happening, the chances of success 
are against us but it is not impossible.


You are not required to keep keys indefinitely, or give up a key you 
don't have, but the rules regarding the assumption that you know a key 
at least partially reverse the normal burden of proof.



m-o-o-t will be there on the day. m-o-o-t is a freeware live CD 
containing OS and applications, including an ephemerally keyed messaging 
service, and a steganographic file system.

If anyone knows of any other technologies to defeat this coercive attack 
I would be glad to hear of them, and perhaps include them in m-o-o-t.
