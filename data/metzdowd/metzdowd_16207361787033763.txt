There is also a legal distinction between a personal
credit card and a corporate card in terms of the 
regulated upper bound on the losses due to a stolen
card and fraudulent charges on it, though the credit
companies tend never to stand on their right to not
rescind fraudulent charges on non-personal cards.

Factoid: Had the $50 stop-loss limit been indexed for
inflation, then it would today be $300.  (1968-present)
