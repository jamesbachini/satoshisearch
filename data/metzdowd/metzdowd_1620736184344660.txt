That whole paragraph, taken together, makes no sense.

There is a difference between code changes in the kernel for some 
systems (which you allude to above), code changes and a universal 
rollout in all DNS software (which you allude to at the end), and 
stable rollout of the DNSSEC trust anchor system in every significant 
zone and all resolvers.

FWIW, only the latter has anything to do with this mailing list...
