<PRE>Thanks for your thoughts on this Hal. Quite educational.

Ok, so what tools did you use to ascertain that? I'm curious. 


&gt;<i> The generator g=2 generates the entire group,
</I>&gt;<i> which is an OK choice. 
</I>
Same here.


&gt;<i> But that shouldn't matter,

</I>
It is hashed, but isn't used to gen further keys. I'm crafting a review of the 
full DH exchange in the target spec that I'll post to the list today.


&gt;<i> The main problem as I said is that 1024 bit moduli are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> considered sufficiently safe for more than casual purposes.
</I>
That's what I thought. 


&gt;<i> Particularly
</I>&gt;<i> with discrete logs that use a widely-shared modulus like the one above,
</I>&gt;<i> it would not be surprising to see it publicly broken in the next 5-10

</I>&gt;<i> efforts could already succeed today.
</I>
Yep. 


thanks again,
