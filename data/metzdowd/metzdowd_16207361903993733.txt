I looked into this at moderate length about two years ago.  One very
attractive choice was the cheapest Motorola Coldfire with their onboard
crypto block, because you get the hashing for free and don't waste host
resources transferring in data you'll then distill by hash -- or hashing
it.

As a source of random numbers, I was figuring to use one of the publically
available thermal noise designs plus the cheapest HiFn PCI crypto chip
(which features a multi-oscillator RNG I'm reasonably familiar with) since
the Coldfire with crypto has both USB and PCI on it.
