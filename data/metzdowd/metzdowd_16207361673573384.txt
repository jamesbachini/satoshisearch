Subject: US drafting plan to allow government access to any email or Web search

Quoting from:

        <A HREF="http://rawstory.com/news/2007/US_drafting_plan_to_allow_government_0114.html">http://rawstory.com/news/2007/US_drafting_plan_to_allow_government_0114.html</A>

        National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell is drawing up
        plans for cyberspace spying that would make the current debate
        on warrantless wiretaps look like a &quot;walk in the park,&quot; according
        to an interview published in the New Yorker's print edition today.

        Debate on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act &quot;will be a
        walk in the park compared to this,&quot; McConnell said. &quot;this is going
        to be a goat rope on the Hill. My prediction is that we're going
        to screw around with this until something horrendous happens.&quot;

        The article, which profiles the 65-year-old former admiral
        appointed by President George W. Bush in January 2007 to oversee
        all of America's intelligence agencies, was not published on
        the New Yorker's Web site. (It can be read here in pdf).

The PDF link points to:

which I'm unable to access at the moment.
