<PRE>Jan Miksovsky (UI designer) has an interesting post on his blog about the
phishing-friendly nature of Facebook apps. Consider the following scenario:

  You get a message from someone you know (well, someone on your Facebook
  friends list, which means a complete stranger you've never met before but
  who you added because whoever dies with the most entries on their list wins)
  saying &quot;Hey, click on/run this!&quot;.  &quot;This&quot; is an unknown app that (by
  default) has access to your information and embeds itself in your Facebook
  experience.

Sound like a phishing attack?  Nope, it's SOP for Facebook:

Facebook (and who knows how may other sites): Hard at work training up the
next generation of phishing victims.
