</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4) The notary signs and dates their record of your signature, optionally

You mean *specified* by the notary - which would presumably be PDF or RTF.

&gt;<i> generate the digital signature on the notary's equipment, and then the
</I>&gt;<i> notary indempotently certify your signature (on the same equipment).
</I>
And if the format is PDF or RDF, none of this will prevent the problem 
with MD5 - the problem being that a notarization of one document will 
also notarize as many other of my documents as I please.
