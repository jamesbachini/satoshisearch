Look for general tracking to appear everywhere.
Fast declining gasoline tax revenues will be
replaced with per-mile usage fees, i.e., every
major road becomes a toll road.  Most likely
first in will be California and/or Oregon.

The relationship to this list may then be thin
excepting that the collection and handling of
such data remains of substantial interest.  Of
course, everyone who carries a cell phone has
already decided that convenience trumps security,
at least the kind of security that says &quot;they
can't misuse what they ain't got.&quot;
