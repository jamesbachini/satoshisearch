Hi Adam,

many people have suggested that.  On paper, it looks like a 
solution to the problem, at least to us.

I think however it is going to require quite significant 
support from the user tools to do this.  That is, the user 
application is going to have to manage the sense of lifetime 
over the message.

One tool that does approach this issue at least 
superficially is Skype.  It can be configured to save chat 
messages for different periods of time, I have mine set to 
around 2 weeks currently.

But, then we run slap-bang into the problem that the *other* 
client also keeps messages.  How long are they kept for? 
I'm not told, and of course even if I was told, we can all 
imagine the limitations of that.

I hypothesise that it might be possible to use contracts to 
address this issue, at least for a civil-not-criminal scope. 
  That is, client software could arrange a contractual 
exchange between Alice and Bob where they both agree to keep 
messages for X weeks, and if not, then commitments and 
penalties might apply.  Judges will look at contracts like 
that and might rule the evidence out of court, in a civil 
dispute.

OK, so we need a lawyer to work that out, and I'm definately 
whiteboarding here, I'm not sure if the solution is worth 
the effort.

Which is why I am skeptical of schemes like &quot;delete the 
private key periodically.&quot;  Unless we solve or address the 
counterparty problem, it just isn't worth the effort to be 
totally secure on our own node.

We know how to do invisible ink in cryptography.  How do we 
do its converse, fading ink?
