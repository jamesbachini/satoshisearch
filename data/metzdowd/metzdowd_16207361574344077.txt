<PRE>I would have thought PBKDF2 would be the obvious, standardized (PKCS
#5 / RFC 2898) and designed for purpose method to derive a key from a
password.  PBKDF2 would typically be based on HMAC-SHA1.

Should be straight-forward to use PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA-256 instead for
larger key sizes, or for avoidance of SHA1 since the partial attacks
on it.
