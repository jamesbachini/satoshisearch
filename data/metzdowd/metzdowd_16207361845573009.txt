&gt;<i> Perhaps there is something subtle here that is more dangerous than the

</I>
It's not a smokescreen, it's a statistical workaround.

CERT/CC mentions this:

|<i> It is important to note that without changes to the DNS protocol, such
</I>|<i> as those that the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) introduce, these
</I>|<i> mitigations cannot completely prevent cache poisoning.

&gt;<i> A statement from the MaraDNS author [3]:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> MaraDNS is immune to the new cache poisoning attack.
</I>
I think the CERT/CC statement is more approriate.
