<PRE>It seems that a large chunk (and probably relative soon nearly all) voice 
is now via VoIP.
And to date, Skype not withstanding, this has all been cleartext 
traffic.  Using router
netflow records, etc., one can now pinpoint any phone conversation and then 
do a pcap
dump. Many Tier 1 through Tier 3 internet carriers are now deploying this 
type of L7 deep
packet inspection directed analysis.  Currently they are limited to about 
10 Gbps (L4 DPI),
but soon 40 Gbps will be available.
