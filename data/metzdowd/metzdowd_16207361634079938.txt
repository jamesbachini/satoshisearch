I've done quite a bit of work with this protocol. The protocol assumes
the existence of an Election Authority. The Authority has the master
keys required to generate certain data sets, and these keys give the
Authority the ability to associate ballot numbers with votes. Note
that this doesn't necessarily give the Authority the ability to
associate people with votes.

There are no per-ballot keys, so there is no partial exposure risk.
It's all-or-nothing.

What is &quot;the&quot; whole problem? Please provide an attack model.
