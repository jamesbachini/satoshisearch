I should have said that in the special sub-case where 
the member word has entropy density XX=100% _or_ in 
the special sub-case where M=1, XOR is as good as it
gets.  In all other cases I can think of, the hash 
approach is much better.

(I excluded the XX=100% case earlier in the note, but
I should have included it in the summary.  Sorry.)
