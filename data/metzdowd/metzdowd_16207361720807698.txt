Yes, but.

If a browser handled unknown certificates similarly to the way SSH  
does -- to alert the user when it sees an unknown, unrooted  
certificate, and then only again when there is a mis-match, you would  
have an incentive to get a CA certificate (because businesses don't  
want their customers to see that scary message even once), while  
supporting ad-hoc infrastructures.

This would require only software changes, not changes in the trust  
models, CAs, procedures, etc.

A wicked person would suggest that this is because the present system  
was designed to support the business model, not the security model.  
I'm not a wicked person and would never suggest that.
