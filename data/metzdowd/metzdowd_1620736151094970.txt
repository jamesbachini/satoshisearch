I still don't follow. BitLocker explicitly includes a (optionally  
file-based) recovery password. If you want central management, why  
not centrally manage _that_?

The reason the TPM is used to wrap the BitLocker key is not because  
people don't want the key to be available outside of hardware -- at  
least I've never heard of that requirement going hand in hand with  
central key backup/migrate. Instead, TPM key wrapping is used so the  
early-boot checks can be enforced. I don't see how a hardware-only  
key that you can migrate to another TPM centrally is any more secure  
than keeping a key in hardware but falling back on a centrally- 
managed spare for enabling data migration.
