<PRE>Lets say you've been tasked with implementing a DRM system.  So you go to the
Digital Content Protection LLC site and download the HDCP spec, which contains
all the test vectors, sample keys, and whatnot, that you need for HDCP.

However, since it's from Digital Content Protection LLC, the docs are DRM'd
(PDF-protected from copying).  So you can eyeball the key tables and test
vectors that you need to implement the DRM, you just can't use them.

DRM, helping prevent... DRM.
