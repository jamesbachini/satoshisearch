My read on Skype is that they are doing a world
leading job when it comes to avoiding vulnerabilities,
better, indeed than the operating systems on which
they run.

One could call it a design weakness that to interface 
with the plain old telephone system there has to be
a knowable, fixed in-the-clear peering to the POTS.
If I am a state actor or equivalent, I do not need
to bother myself with breaking VoIP crypto -- I just
insert some tool into the peering point where the
Skype caller reverts to the ordinary.

Yes, a state may be interested in two parties each
of whom has a Skype instance and thus the demodulation
for POTS does not occur, but two such parties, if
they really care, would do their own end-to-end
protections even if it is a simple as speaking
Navajo.

All hail Saltzer, Reed, and Clark.
