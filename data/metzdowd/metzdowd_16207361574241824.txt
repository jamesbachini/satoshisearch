   Never needed one. The hoops involved aren't THAT large, at least in
the version I use - click the padlock icon in the right hand side of the
navigation (address/url) box, then the &quot;view&quot; button on the page that
presents.

you can manually approve certificates of course, however there are a few 
tools I find useful.

this one remembers which certificates were (mistakenly) presented by 
which domains, so it won't ask you again. it also does something similar 
to allow already-expired certs to function.

the author has a blog here where he discusses aspects of the tool and 
related technologies:

currently he is blogging about a recently checked-in patch that will add 
similar functionality natively to Firefox, and changes to a host's cert 
that makes it redundant for Thunderbird.
