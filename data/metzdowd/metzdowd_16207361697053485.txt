The situation with CAcert and Mozo is fairly simple.

Mozo ran a long and open design exercise for a CA policy, 
which specifies that each CA requires an audit [1].  CAcert 
hasn't got an audit [2].

Mozo did indeed work quite hard to give CAcert and others 
some more open access to the process.  One could debate the 
wisdom of having an audit at all, or ascribe the motives to 
politics, or whatever [3] ... in the end, Mozo moved a 
considerable distance by opening up the process to 
non-financial-audit firms and to criteria from 
non-consortium authors [4].

CAcert also now conducts an open process [5], so it is much 
easier to talk about the audit.  It is well advanced on the 
policy side, only lacking one or two critical policies which 
are works-in-progress.  Audits generally deliver reports 
that say things like &quot;management has put in place procedures 
and policies...&quot; so CAcert is in good shape here.

Where the audit has stalled is on the systems side (and the 
missing policies are all on that side as well).  CAcert will 
either solve their systems problems or die in the attempt. 
My current estimate is that if CAcert moves seriously to 
solve the systems problems, then it may have the audit by 
early 2009.  If not, not.

You can read more about it [6] or ask me or them or join 
their many mail lists, etc etc.

[1]  The process was led by Frank Hecker on the open mozo 
security maillist.  I was part of that process, as was Duane 
(founder of CAcert), because it was an open process.

IMO, the Mozo CA policy project was a great case study in 
open security, and should be copied by others, including 
other Mozo security processes.

[2] By way of disclosure, I am the auditor.  Minutes of most 
recent published audit report:
<A HREF="http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/AuditPresentations">http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/AuditPresentations</A>

[3] FTR I argued against the requirements for audits.

[4] The case for audits was significantly weakened when 
rumours spread of audited CAs conducting MITMs on their own 
customers, and the logical claim that this was permitted 
under audit as long as it was disclosed, sort of, somewhere, 
maybe.  This was crucial in shifting consensus to allow 
competition in audit criteria and auditors.

[5] Due to direction from Greg Rose (retiring President) and 
a funding deal with NLnet that imposes frequent public reports.
