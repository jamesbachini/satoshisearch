The only reason this 'must' be true is because an anonymous and secure
payment system is a terror which thankfully our federal governments
and central banks protect us from. While Amazon and others obviously
like being able to build customer profiles of everyone, I don't doubt
that they would be perfectly willing to accept an anonymous payment as
long as the money is good (and, of course, that the transaction costs
are no more than a credit card and/or the order flow is sufficient
that it is worth building support for it).
