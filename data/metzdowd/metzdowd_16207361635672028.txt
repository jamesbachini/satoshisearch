<PRE>In my personal experience, if you are developing a mass-market item with 
conventional crypto (e.g., SSL, S/MIME, etc ) then it is fairly routine to 
get a commodity export license which lets you sell globally.

Disclaimers abound, including that I'm not a lawyer and certainly don't 
speak for IBM.
