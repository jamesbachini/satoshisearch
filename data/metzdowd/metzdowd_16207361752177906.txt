<PRE>There are some situations when this can be dangerous. It's a matter of
implementation. I can directly come up with one trivial scenario that
will end you up in trouble:

Assume that you are using AES-CTR (AES in Counter mode) and do not
change the IV between the two encryptions. In this case you will
correctly encrypt the data, but the second encryption will leave A
unprotected.
