The quote from the article was:

&quot;There are, of course, obstacles that must still be overcome by EKMI 
proponents. For example, the proposed components are somewhat simple 
by design, which concerns some encryption purists who prefer more 
complex protocols, on the logic that they're more difficult to break 
into.&quot;

It jumps from &quot;components&quot; to &quot;protocols&quot;. In general, &quot;encryption 
purists&quot; like simpler algorithms. OTOH, when &quot;encryption purists&quot; get 
involved in protocol design, the protocols usually become complex to 
the point of opacity.

So, I agree with Peter that that article is probably correct about protocols.
