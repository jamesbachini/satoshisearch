Unfortunately, it is voluntary. I just took a quick look and the
Elcomsoft patent application has not shown up there yet.

I did find a crypto related patent application on &quot;Peer to Patent&quot;,
&quot;Cipher method and system for verifying a decryption of an encrypted
user data key&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20070160202/activity">http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20070160202/activity</A>&gt;.
You can view the application and existing comments (and comment
yourself).

The &quot;Peer to Patent&quot; system is only a pilot program. It works by
people submitting evidence about a patent and the ten most voted for
pieces of evidence get submitted along with the patent application to
the examiner. For participating, an inventor gets expedited patent
examination. There have been blogs saying &quot;Peer to Patent&quot; aspires to
be a reputation-based system but I don't see it there yet.
