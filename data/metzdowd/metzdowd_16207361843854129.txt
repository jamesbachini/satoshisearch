Isn't this true in general about nearly all security or cryptography?

At CyberCash, where we had real RSA/DES in the system, we found that
&quot;users want convenience, not security&quot;

We built a paypal equivalent on top of our real security. Paypal made it
look like they had security, but were convenient.

Which company was sold for over a Billion? and which went bankrupt?

Most &quot;attacks&quot; are more social engineering than breaking crypto.
