What, specifically, are you proposing?  Running the web over UDP?
That's the only alternative that I can see short of modifying TCP or
IPsec.  I doubt any of those three will take the web world by storm, but
HTTP over DTLS over UDP would have to be least unlikely, and even then,
I strongly doubt it.

I think we'll just have to deal with those round-trips.  As long as
there be plenty of other, cheaper or more practical ways to improve web
app performance, that's all we're likely to see pursued.
