Yes- the IronKey like just about EVERY security product right now  
lacks a trusted path. However, they address this by suggesting that you:
	a. Use a &quot;clean&quot; PC to install your passwords into Mozilla's  
password manager, and
	b. use the mozilla's password manager from the USB device.
This mitigates the lack of a trusted path between the user and the  
USB device.

Granted the average user can't discern a &quot;clean&quot; machine from a &quot;non- 
clean&quot; machine. But, I think they've addressed your issue as best  
they can.

The marketing is a bit over the top, but hardly snake oil.

p.s. I have no relationship with Ironkey.
