</I>On the other hand ... from a report in Computerworld, we have:

	[Jon] Edwards [a senior clean room engineer at Kroll
	Ontrack, which did the recovery work] said the
	circuit board on the bottom of the drive was &quot;burned
	almost beyond recognition&quot; and that all of its
	components had fallen off. Every piece of plastic on
	the model ST9385AG hard drive melted, he noted, and
	all the electronic chips inside had burned and come
	loose.
	
	Edwards said the Seagate hard drive -- which was
	about eight years old in 2003 -- featured much
	greater fault tolerance and durability than current
	hard drives of similar capacity.
	
	Two other hard drives aboard the Columbia were so
	severely damaged that it was impossible to extract
	any usable data, he added.
