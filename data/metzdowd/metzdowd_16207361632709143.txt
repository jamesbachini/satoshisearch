Enter Reality 2.0. Yesterday, security was based on authority --
on some particular agency or expert. Today, security is /also/ based
on anyone else that can point out non-compliance, and solutions.

The integrity of the FIPS program, and any other evaluation process,
can only increase when [x] are also able (entirely on their own and
not by a mandate) to point out non-compliance of evaluated products
-- proprietary or open source -- to basic architectural requirements
of the standard. Here [x] = competitors, attackers, outside experts,
anyone in general.

Cheers,
