And, within a few days, the open source folks have reverse engineered
it. The presence of &quot;magic numbers&quot; in the algorithm makes one assume
that this was intended as more than a simple hash integrity check, but
the brief time required to find them leads one to believe the
mechanism was not a very effective protection (though it isn't even
clear what it was intended to protect against.)
