and in it is the following quote:

&gt;<i> Last month, the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
</I>&gt;<i> began distributing chips with hidden Trojan horse circuitry to
</I>&gt;<i> military contractors who are participating in the agency's Trusted
</I>&gt;<i> Integrated Circuits program. The goal is to test forensic techniques
</I>&gt;<i> for finding hidden electronic trap doors, which can be maddeningly
</I>&gt;<i> elusive. The agency is not yet ready to announce the results of the
</I>&gt;<i> test, according to Jan Walker, a spokeswoman for the agency.

Hmmmm....

Best,
