<PRE>|<i> ...One example was his comparison between the security business and the
</I>|<i> used-car &quot;lemons&quot; market. The idea is that lemons dominate the used-car
</I>|<i> market due to asymmetric information: only the sellers know which cars
</I>|<i> are lemons, hence these are the ones that are mostly made available,
</I>|<i> hence buyers assume all cars are likely to be lemons, hence good cars
</I>|<i> can't be sold for a higher price and are largely kept off the market.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> However security products are not really that much like used cars. Used
</I>|<i> cars are individually unique and it is impossible to know in advance
</I>|<i> how well they will work. That's where the asymmetric information
</I>|<i> comes from. But security products are more like other retail products;
</I>|<i> each one has its own characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, and
</I>|<i> there are ways consumers can find out about them in advance....
</I>Information about used cars is available, too:  You can take the car
to an independent mechanic for evaluation - there are mechanics who,
in fact, establish their independence by doing *nothing* but such
inspections, so that there is no suspicion that they are creating
work for themselves.  Histories of cars are available on line.
General information about models of cars is also readily available.

However, there's a non-trivial cost to the consumer to get hold of
this information.  Enough people, enough of the time, are not willing
to pay that cost, to drive the marketplace.

I would argue that the situation is the same for security software.
Only a tiny fraction of the computer-using population reads reviews
of anti-virus software - or could understand anything beyond a table
of raw detection numbers if they had such reviews in their hands.
What drives anti-virus installation is normally (a) what can on
the computer when you bought it; (b) word of mouth with no real
basis in fact; (c) familiarity of the product name.

In fact, the anti-virus field - if you look at the major vendors -
delivers reasonable, and reasonably equivalent, products.  For the
vast majority of people, the difference between having no anti-virus
product and having any of the big ones far exceeds the practical
differences among them.  Where information asymmetry would arise
would be with a new, essentially ineffective, product which would
be pushed out with a large burst of advertising claims, viral
marketing, etc.  Because there are a number of competing incumbents,
however, there isn't much room for someone to play this game:  They
would have to sell so cheaply that the profit wouldn't be there.

The above is for the *PC* antivirus market.  The Mac antivirus market
provides an interesting counterpoint.  Not to get into arguments about
whether a Mac *can* get a virus, in practice, there are none in the
wild today.  So any Mac anti-virus based on scanning has an actual
value of ... nothing, since there is nothing to scan for.  (A
good behavioral monitor might make sense, though building up the
needed models without actual attack examples is difficult.)  Still,
people do sell Mac anti-virus scanners; they even advertise the
size of the scanning databases they come with (vaguely).  In that
submarket, asymmetry of information clearly plays a role.

However, let's go back to the more general question.  Anti-virus
programs can at least be tested - whether against huge (and thus
meaningless) collections of viruses, or against viruses that are
known to be threats.  But that's hardly the only security software
out there.  Encryption software is a hell of a lot harder to test,
and in fact I've yet to see a *meaningful* test outside of the
specialist literature.  Oh, people will talk about the ease of
use of the software, and they'll parrot the makers claims about
how many bits of key they use; but whether the thing provides any
actual security ... who knows?  Asymmetry of information is the
rule here, which is why &quot;snake oil&quot; continues to be sold regularly.

Other security products fall somewhere in between.  Firewalls
don't seem to get much testing, though their funtions should be
reasonably easy to test - and explain.  But firewalls seem to be
seen as part of the plumbing that most people don't, and don't
want to, know anything about.  Intrusion detection systems are,
as far as I can tell, basically black boxes.  The algorithms and
rules are proprietary, no one really knows how to test them, and
you buy on the reputation of the vendor.  Highly asymmetrical.
