The IronKey appears to provide decent security while it is NOT  
plugged into a PC. But as soon as you plug it in and you have to  
enter a password to unlock it, the security level quickly drops. This  
would be the case even if they supported Mac OS or *nix.

As I stated in my response to Jerry Leichter, in my opinion, their  
marketing department is selling snake oil.

Aram
