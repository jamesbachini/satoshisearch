<PRE>Hello,

Actually, block ciphers encrypting blocks of *decimal* numbers exist:

- TOY100 [1] encrypts blocks of 32 decimal digits
- DEAN18 [2] encrypts blocks of 18 decimal digits
- DEAN27 [3] encrypts blocks of 27 decimal digits

TOY100 is (almost) broken by the generalized linear cryptanalysis  
described in [2]. Both versions of DEAN are based on a substitution  
permutation network very close to that of the AES and are provably  
secure against linear cryptanalysis. These ciphers are only &quot;toy&quot;  
ciphers. Consequently, there is no official implementation (no test- 
vector, etc.).

Here are the references:
[1] Granboulan, Levieil, Piret: Pseudorandom Permutation Families over  
Abelian Groups. FSE 2006: 57-77
[2] Baign&#232;res, Stern, Vaudenay: Linear Cryptanalysis of Non Binary  
Ciphers. Selected Areas in Cryptography 2007: 184-211 (available here: <A HREF="http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/~tbaigner/papers/groupLC.pdf">http://lasecwww.epfl.ch/~tbaigner/papers/groupLC.pdf</A> 
  )

Designs and Security Tools (to be published)

I hope this helps. I'm of course available for any question regarding  
DEANxx.

Best regards,
Thomas Baign&#232;res

</I>&gt;<i> Let's say we have various 40-digit decimal numbers:

</I>&gt;<i>
