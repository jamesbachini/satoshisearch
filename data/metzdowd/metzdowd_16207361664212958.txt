It's not just older people, it's manual workers, children, and (as a
generalisation for all biometrics) &quot;goats&quot;, the percentage of the overall
population who don't produce useful results for whatever biometric is being
employed.  The population of goats (for a reasonable FAR/FRR) is usually in
the low single digits.  The standard response to goats is to wind down the FRR
until the problem is no longer noticeable.  More on this in
<A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/biometrics.pdf.">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/biometrics.pdf.</A>

(FAR = false acceptance rate, FRR = false rejection rate).
