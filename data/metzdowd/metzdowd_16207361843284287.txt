Ah, more 3 monkeys syndrome? If a flaw exists but nobody knows about 
the details, it no longer exists? If we don't publish the evidence 
about the Earth being round, then it will stay flat, right? Perhaps 
NXP merely wants to secure the job continuity of sys admins, 
compliance, and security people, do you think?

Given that those in charge rarely listen in any case, perhaps they 
are trying to promote stress related health problems in a secret 
conspiracy with doctors. ;-&gt;

Best,
