Cell phones have that.

The bigger problem is pairing with the local POS (or whatever), which is
where NFC comes in -- the &quot;obvious&quot; thing to do here is to make this
pairing not-really-wireless (e.g., the cell phone could scan a barcode
from the POS, or the POS could scan a barcode displayed by the cell
phone, or both, or any number of variants of this).

Right, it's got to be wireless :)
