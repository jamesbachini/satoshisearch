<PRE>yes, the reputation of/quality of reporters needs to be measured, and  
the reported information needs to be enough to
accomplish an auth or a card purchase.

the card issuer can then use a credible report as a hint to increase  
the level of attention to the reported cards.

it's in a merchant's interest to have high quality fraud detection  
because this report is
in association with an attempted purchase transaction and their report  
implies they
decline or refund the transaction they are turning down the revenue  
from that card,

if a bad guy wants to break into a merchant's site, i would welcome  
them to immediately report all the merchant's cards as stolen
rather than than stealing them and using them or waiting for the  
merchant to do so in a breach notice.
