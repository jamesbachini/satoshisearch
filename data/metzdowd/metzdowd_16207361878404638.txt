<PRE>Some colleagues (Hovav Shacham, Brandon Enright, Scott Yikel, and
Stefan Savage) and I have been doing some followup work on the Debian
OpenSSL PRNG bug. Perry suggested that some cryptography readers
might be interested in our preliminary analysis of the DHE angle,
which can be found here:

Also, Hovav gave a WIP on this topic at USENIX Security. The slides are at:
