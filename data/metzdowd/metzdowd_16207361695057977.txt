The security target for the gambling industry is to pass (incredibly
stringent) auditing requirements.  A simple PRNG seeded from a factory-set
initial value is fine as long as it's been certified to death.  The impression
I got from this some time ago from people who work in this area was that they
really wanted deterministic PRNGs rather than nondeterministic hardware ones,
although at the time I didn't ask whether it was because it made certification
easier or because they just didn't trust unpredictable RNGs (&quot;unpredictable&quot;
meaning that an infinite number of environmental variations can cause it to
potentially do things that you don't want).
