<PRE>Reported on Computerworld recently:  To &quot;improve security&quot;, a system
was modified to ask one of a set of fixed-form questions after the
password was entered.  Users had to provide the answers up front to
enroll.  One question:  Mother's maiden name.  User provides the
4-character answer.  System refuses to accept it:  Answer must have
at least 6 characters.

I can just see the day when someone's fingerprint is rejected as
&quot;insufficiently complex&quot;.
