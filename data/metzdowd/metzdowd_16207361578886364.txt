Suppose you did have a convenient way to display the SSL certificate  
for every site whenever you loaded a page from the site.  You  
probably wouldn't want to memorize all the certificates for the  
secure sites that you care about, so you might instead write some  
notes on a piece of paper next to your computer, for example writing  
down an SSL certificate and then next to it writing &quot;bank&quot;, and then  
writing down another one and then next to it writing &quot;mail&quot;, and so on.

Then, whenever you load a page, you would look at the SSL certificate  
that is linked to that page and glance at your notepad to see which  
description it maps to.  If you are looking at a random web site that  
you've never seen before, and the certificate doesn't appear on your  
notes, then no big deal.  If you are looking at a page that appears  
to belong to your bank, and the certificate that came with that page  
doesn't appear on your notes, then this is a big red flag!  Likewise,  
if you are looking at a page that appears to belong to your bank, and  
the certificate appears on your notes, but the note next to it  
doesn't say &quot;bank&quot;, then this is a red flag, too!  For example, it  
might be the certificate of your mail service, which appears on your  
paper along with the note &quot;mail&quot;.  Or it might just be a certificate  
that appears on your paper along with the note &quot;joke site from Harry&quot;.

Note that a system which classified certificates into &quot;trusted&quot; or  
&quot;untrusted&quot; categories might give you the green flag even when a  
certificate that you trust to serve up good jokes is serving up  
something that appears to be your bank account.

So, the thing about writing down certificates and mapping them to  
short hand-written notes is what the Pet Name Toolbar automates for you:
