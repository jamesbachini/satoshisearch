Proposing something new won't help make that available sooner than SCTP
if that something new, like SCTP, must be implemented in kernel-land.

This is what session resumption is all about, and now that we have a way
to do it without server-side state (RFC4507) there should be no more
complaints.

If the latency of multiple key exchanges is the issue then we should
push for deployment of RFC4507 before we go push for a brand new
transport protocol.

If I understand what you mean then the ticket in RFC4507 is just that.
