I've repeatedly heard excuses that the cryptographers in the wifi 
debacle believed that they could only design a solution based on 
significant hardware restrictions/constraints. part of what i observed 
... by the time any of them shipped ... the hardware 
restrictions/constraints no longer existed . the other thing that i 
observed was that with relatively trivial knowledge about chips ... it 
was possible to come up with an integrated solution that incorporated 
both the necessary hardware and the necessary cryptography  ...  there 
has got to be some analogy here someplace about the blind trying to 
describe an elephant; in addition to the &quot;point solution&quot; analogy, 
failing to take in the overall infrastructure.

i've repeatedly claimed that we did that in the AADS chip strawman solution
