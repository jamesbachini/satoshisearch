Sorta. TLS gets along with self signed just fine though, and obviously 
you can choose to accept a root or unsigned cert on a per-client basis.

sure. for IE its just a registry key, trivial to push out using login 
scripts etc.

&gt;<i> Are there any options that don't involve adding a new root CA?

buying a intermediate cert from an existing CA? buying a &quot;wildcard&quot; cert 
  for your domain, and using the same wildcard cert on all nodes?

at one point, you could use *any* cert to sign another cert; IE didn't 
bother checking. I believe they have fixed that now.
