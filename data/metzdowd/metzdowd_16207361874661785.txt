I was wrong, this was from Crypto 03. And as Eric Rescorla has already
pointed out, Patarin had an improved the result the following year where
he showed that 6 rounds was sufficient for security.

Hmmm, looking at Rivest's &quot;package transform&quot; which was his original
proposal for an AONT, that seems to be different and actually expanded
the message size. I haven't been able to find an AONT which is quite
like this.

One limitation with this proposal is that it appears that it will only
be as strong as the size of the overlapping region. However in this case
the overlap is 128-5 or 123 bits, so the birthday bound will be about
2^62 rather than the ideal 2^64, and that is hardly noticeable. So it
does seem like it could be a good choice here. Doing a little over 3 AES
encryptions will be much better than the 6 which seem to be necessary for
the Feistel approach. However such a substantial improvement certainly
makes a proof of security more interesting.
