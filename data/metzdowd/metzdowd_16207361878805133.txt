The keynote talk for the USENIX Security Symposium was 

      Dr. Strangevote or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
      and Love the Paper Ballot

      Debra Bowen, California Secretary of State 


and her talk had one slide only.  I do not have the
slide, but I can reproduce it.  It was a photo of
the tail end of her car and on it a bumper sticker.
That bumper sticker read

  
      PREVENT UNWANTED PRESIDENCIES
      MAKE VOTE COUNTING A HAND JOB

get away with such a bumper sticker, but...
