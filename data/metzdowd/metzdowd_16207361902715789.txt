You're think about this from the wrong angle.  We don't need to legislate
network security because, as you say, we'll never get a workable law, and even
if we did we really have no idea how to build secure systems that users would
actually want to use (although there are some good hypotheses out there).

What we need is real-world controls (that have nothing to do with computers)
to rein in the free hand that computerisation has given to attackers.  Credit
freezes are the first step, although even then it's been a massive battle and
most likely Congress will eventually pass a law that neutralises the various
state laws, as it has for numerous other laws in the past (and even some of
the state laws have been watered down with &quot;thaw&quot; provisions that take you
right back to square one).

Some examples that come to mind immediately for fighting phishing:

- Credit freezes that are real freezes, and require a physical bank visit with
ID to thaw.

- COB and credit-limit-increase freezes that require physical presence to
change (the first thing phishers do when they get your CC info is to wind the
credit limit up to max and change the billing address).  The once a blue moon
that you might want to change these details it's really not to hard to drop by
a bank for a minute or two to authorise things.

- Ability to specify floor limits for spending independent of the credit
limit, e.g. with a credit limit of $10K you can't spend more than $2K
domestically and $1K internationally.

I think that should give you a general idea of where this is going.  At the
moment the banks' fraud-guessing systems are really just that, guessing
systems, and from numerous reports and assorted anecdotal evidence they're not
very effective.  The user holds the &quot;position of the interior&quot;, they know
better than any guessing system what's appropriate and what isn't for their
financial transactions.  The rampant exploitation of the banking system by
crooks works because all of the above are totally uncontrolled, and banks have
no interest in controlling them.  That's what we need legislation for, not to
require two-factor-authentication-that-isn't and other gimmicks but to get the
banks and credit-reporting agencies to install effective internal controls.
