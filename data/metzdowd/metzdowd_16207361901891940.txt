No, interaction between different software packages has 
costs.  When you spend time to load up Thunderbird, then 
load up enigmail, then load up gpg ... this is more work 
than just loading up Tbird and sticking with it.

Then, when a new Thunderbird comes out, you load that up and 
the other packages cease to work.  What do you do?  Wait a 
few months until the others come back into line?  Or stop 
using encrypted email.  The masses do the latter, the geeks 
might do the former.

Most people download one thing and stick to it.  They follow 
the automated upgrades, or don't upgrade at all.  Most 
people have a life other than package management.  These are 
the masses.  For them, the softare has to work first time, 
every time, all the time.  And upgrade itself.

These are the target.  Aiming to do security for geeks alone 
is pointless, it just marks us out for special treatment. 
Using gpg is evidence of your guilt.  Using skype is normal, 
it's just the easiest way to chat and phone.
