we had gotten tasked to do a design and costing of mondex implementation
in the states (all the transaction processing dataprocessing, sizing
capacity and resources, etc) ... and looking at pricing various kinds
of mondex related transactions (&quot;super brick&quot; from mondex international
and how it flowed thru the rest of the infrastructure).

the conclusion we came up with was that nearly all the financial
justification for mondex was in the float. later there were scenarios
where mondex international was encouraging deployment in various
countries by offering to split the float with the chartered
mondex national body (and then it seemed like float offerings were
starting to peculate down to financial institutions lower in
the mondex hierarchy)

then along came an EU statement that mondex (and similar implementations)
would only be given a grace period with regard to retaining the float
(as a mechanism to underwrite start-up costs) ... but after a period
of 2-3 yrs, they were then going to be required to start paying interest on
balances carried in the cards. after that, much of the interest(?) seemed
to evaporate.

separately there were some issues with the chip technology being
used in the mondex cards.

misc. past posts mentioning mondex.
