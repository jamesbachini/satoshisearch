A former boss has become &quot;Head of Fraud Technology&quot; (I asked him who
was &quot;Head of Anti-Fraud Technology&quot;) and he answers like this.

  I am not really a cards man but I would have said the good
  old telephone, a call to the acquirer, would be the way. The
  acquirer would then pass that on to the issuer. Granted the
  merchant may not know for certain that had happened, but he
  has done his duty at that point.
