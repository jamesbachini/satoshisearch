My experience was the same, although I needed some initial help with 
GPG.  Since then, updates have been trouble-free.

My only problem with the security model is that Thunderbird/Enigmail 
stores encrypted messages in encrypted form, and there is no option to 
store the plaintext.  This use of a communications key for stored data 
is potentially a nuisance - a key corruption or other compromise, or 
just a wish to delete an old key for forward security, would cause much 
trouble.  (I keep my mail in an encrypted container anyway, so don't 
need this feature.)

This apart, the system runs with remarkable simplicity.
