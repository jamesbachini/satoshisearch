Someone who works for a Russian bank told me that it was designed to ensure
that FAPSI got paid [0].  In other words the government recognises that trying
to regulate encryption use is pointless, but since corporates can't afford to
flout the law this measure guarantees a steady cashflow.

Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by baksheesh.
