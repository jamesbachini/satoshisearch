One obvious application I can think of is Diffie-Hellman session key generation
for web or email servers that handle lots of sessions.
Sure, you _could_ use PRNGs to generate the keys, with real RNG now and then,
but a fast RNG can help protect you against one popular threat model, which 
is &quot;auditors&quot;.
