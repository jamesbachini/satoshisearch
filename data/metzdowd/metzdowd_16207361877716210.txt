</I>These kinds of questions used to bother me.  Then I realized that
*I could lie*.  As long as *I* remember that I answer &quot;What is your
mother's maiden name&quot; with &quot;xyzzy&quot;, the site and I can be happy.

Well ... happier, anyway.  The only way to remain sane if you take
this approach is to use the same answer at every site that asks
these security questions.  But that's not good, especially since
most of these sites appear to make the *actual value you specified*
available to their call centers.  This is nice if you can't remember
the exact capitalization you used, but it does, of course, leak more
information that you'd rather have out there readily accessible.

For Web sites these days, I generate random strong passwords and keep
them on a keychain on my Mac.  Actually, the keychain gets synchronized
automatically across all my Mac's using .mac/MobileMe (for all their
flaws).  When I do this, I enter random values that I don't even
record for the security questions.  Should something go wrong, I'm
going to end up on the phone with a rep anyway, and they will have
some other method for authenticating me (or, of course, a clever
social-engineering attacker).

The only alternative I've seen to this whole approach is sold by
RSA (owned by EMC; I have nothing to do with the product, but will
note my association with the companies) which authenticates based on
real-world data.  For example, you might be asked where you got
coffee this morning if your credit card shows such a charge.  This
approach is apparently quite effective if used correctly - though
it does feel pretty creepy.  (They were watching me buy coffee?)
