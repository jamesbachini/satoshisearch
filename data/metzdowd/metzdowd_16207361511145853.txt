Your argument just went from &quot;TPMs are bad for volume encryption with  
BitLocker because they can't be centrally managed&quot; to &quot;Microsoft  
should provide tools to centrally manage key recovery files because I  
find doing it myself too hard&quot;. Which are you actually arguing? I've  
tried to show you that the first argument is _wrong_; the second  
argument has nothing to do with TPMs. You have a choice when it comes  
to how you approach the recovery keyfile problem. You can build tools  
for it, or any company that perceives a market need can do so.
