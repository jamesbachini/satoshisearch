<PRE>So, an executive summary of your responses appears to be &quot;EKMI leaves 
all the hard/impossible problems to be solved by components that are out 
of scope&quot;.

As such, I'm not seeing much value.

Anyway...

PKI out of scope...

...impossibility of solving DRM problem out of scope...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> EKMI's goals are not to provide bullet-proof security.  It has more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> modest ambitions - to provide a management framework for incremental
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> security, targeted at the right resource: the data, rather than the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> network.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there any even vaguely modern systems that target the network for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security, or is this a straw man?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I meant to say is that EKMI's goal is to protect the data and not
</I>&gt;<i> the network.
</I>
...goals the same as pretty much all cryptographic protocols...

&gt;&gt;<i> If it is up to them, then why bother with this verification process? 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This sounds like yet more security theatre to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure which verification process you're referring to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, this is not security theater.  EKMI does not guarantee anything, nor
</I>&gt;<i> does it promise unbreakable anything.  Everything in EKMI is a choice.
</I>&gt;<i> You get to choose the strength of your keys, your PKI, your policies,
</I>&gt;<i> your procedures and your implementation.  All we're offering is a tool
</I>&gt;<i> that does something specific to the extent that the specifications and
</I>&gt;<i> the technology allows.  Nothing more, nothing less.  If you - as a
</I>&gt;<i> cryptographer - say that AES-156 will do X under these conditions, then
</I>&gt;<i> EKMI will support X under those conditions.  EKMI only adds the ability
</I>&gt;<i> to manage a large number of keys centrally, and to ease many of the
</I>&gt;<i> administrative burdens we see that large-scale key-management can cause.
</I>&gt;<i> Everything it does is constrained by the limitations of the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> technology components, polices and practices.  But you still have to
</I>&gt;<i> make the choice.
</I>
...security out of scope and scope out of scope.

Is there anything other than key escrow that's actually in scope?

Cheers,

Ben.
