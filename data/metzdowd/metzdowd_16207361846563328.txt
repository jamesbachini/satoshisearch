post in thread here a yr ago (1jul07) about financial institutions 
attempting some
(disastrous) deployments in the 99/00 time-frame ... and then instead of 
taking
blame for deployment problems ... there was quickly spreading opinion 
that hardware
tokens weren't practical in the consumer market place

as noted in another post ... the disastrous failures were somewhat a case of
institutional knowledge not permeating different part of the organizations.

banking conferences in the mid-90s were attributing the existing online 
banking
migration to the internet in large part motivated by significant 
customer support
problems with serial port modems (mostly with the serial port part).

that even if a little bit of the experience form the earlier online banking
programs had carried over into the later hardware token deployments ...
much of the deployment problems could have been averted.

In any case, the claim could be made that the industry is still attempting
to recover from those disasters.
