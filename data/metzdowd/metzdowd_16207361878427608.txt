Indeed. I'm not on p2p-hackers, so I'm reading this on <A HREF="http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/cryptography">cryptography at .</A>


&gt;<i> If I might speak for another: ekr doesn't believe that an extra RTT of

That's probably a reasonably accurate summary of my position.


&gt;<i> TLS is only one RTT if the session is cached (either server side
</I>&gt;<i> caching or client side). Without modifying TCP, one could push the
</I>&gt;<i> server's exchange into the SYNACK and get this down to 0 extra round
</I>&gt;<i> trips. (needs kernel changes) This would really involve cramming TLS
</I>&gt;<i> into a very small space and the result would look little like TLS.
</I>
I actually am not sure I agree with this assessment of &quot;look little
like TLS&quot;. I haven't spent that much time on this particular
issue, but most of the schemes I've seen for optimizing out TLS round trips 
(e.g., FastTrack) are actually quite minor modifications to TLS.


&gt;<i> However, the issue is that, if clients started doing this, they
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't know if the other end supports it. Thus it wouldn't be very
</I>&gt;<i> opportunistic.
</I>
Well, maybe, maybe not. Remember that if you're doing session
caching, the client and a server have an opportunity do do
discovery in the first handshake.
