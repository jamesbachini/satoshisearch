Is there much work to be done here?  If you view the keyex mechanism as a
producer of an authenticated blob of shared secrecy and the post-keyex
portions (data transfer or whatever you're doing) as a consumer of said blob,
with a PRF as impedance-matcher (as is done by SSL/TLS, SSH, IPsec, ..., with
varying degrees of aplomb, and in a more limited store-and-forward context
PGP, S/MIME, ...), is there much more to consider?
