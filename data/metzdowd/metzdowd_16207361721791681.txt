So far, so good. This disconnect doesn't seem to have done the CA 
industry any harm, though.

</I>
Non sequiteur, plus I can't see why paranoia would prompt me to want to 
do this? What does it prove?

Also, PTR records are only supposed to point to &quot;primary domain names&quot;. 
Since it is common for hosts to have many names resolving to the same IP 
address, by definition most of these will not correspond to the reverse 
lookup.

&gt;<i> 	To do what you want, want, you might consider using the

</I>&gt;<i> 	using DNSSEC signed zones with CERT-rr's would not be a bad
</I>&gt;<i> 	thing.   In fact, thats what we are testing .
</I>
Who is &quot;we&quot; and what exactly are you testing?

Cheers,

Ben.
