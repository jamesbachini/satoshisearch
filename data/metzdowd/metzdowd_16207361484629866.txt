It may be, indeed.  You're going (as Lynn pointed out in another post)
to be fighting an uphill battle against the last attempts.  I don't
think smartcards (per se) are the answer.  What you really need is
something like a palm pilot, with screen and input and a reasonably
trustworthy OS, along with (as you say) the appropriate UI investment.
