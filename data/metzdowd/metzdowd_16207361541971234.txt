<PRE>This year's &quot;BT Young Scientist Award for Mathematics&quot; was awarded to a 19 year old in the field of cryptography. The project, entitled 'An Extension of Weiner's Attack on RSA Encryption' used complex mathematics to challenge the security of keys associated with encryption. Using cutting edge mathematical research, Abdul succeeded in decreasing the security of safe keys, used to decode mathematical messages. Abdul's discoveries have many practical applications in the areas of IT and internet safety.
