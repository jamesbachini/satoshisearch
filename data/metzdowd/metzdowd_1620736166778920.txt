<PRE>Anyone know anything about these guys?  (www.vaultid.com).  They
are trying to implement one-time credit card numbers on devices
you take with you - initially cell phones and PDA's, eventually in
a credit card form factor.  The general idea seems good, but their
heavy reliance on fingerprint recogition is troubling (though it may
be appropriate in their particular application).
