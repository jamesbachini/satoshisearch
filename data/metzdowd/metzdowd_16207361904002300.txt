I was just informed of this 10 minutes ago, privately.

Not sure how I missed this the last time I read the document
(perhaps because I was focusing on remediating an application
related to two other vulnerabilities on a project), but the
bank examiners also apparently missed this for Wachovia.

While login pages are not required to be PCI-DSS compliant
(since they generally do not deal with credit card numbers,
it has been my impression that many companies are adopting
OWASP guidelines for all their web-projects.  Perhaps its
taking time for some more than others.
