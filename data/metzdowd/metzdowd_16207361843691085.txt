<PRE>There was a terrific interdisciplinary workshop this week at MIT on
&quot;security and human behavior&quot;.  Organized by Ross Anderson and
Bruce Schneier, the idea was to bring together security researchers
from diverse fields who don't normally talk with each other: computing,
psychology, economics, criminology, sociology, etc.

There weren't any new earth shattering research results presented;  
rather
the idea was to inspire security thinkers who should be learning from  
each
other (but often don't) to reach outside their own disciplines.   
There's a
lot to learn.

Bruce's comments, with links to an agenda and position papers, are on  
his

I recorded most of the sessions, for those who enjoy listening to hours
of noisy, out-of-context audio of events they didn't attend.  MP3s can
