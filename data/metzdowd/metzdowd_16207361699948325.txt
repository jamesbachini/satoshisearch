Actually, there is one major (but temporary) limitation to TC5: It does 
not process too well partitions that are not the system partition, but 
which share the same physical drive as the system partition, if you 
elect to encrypt the entire drive.

That is, if you decide to encrypt a whole physical drive that stores 
both C: (system) and D: (another partition), you are going to face a 
situation in which your D: partition is logically gone (until you 
re-decrypt the whole thing back). Next version will fix it, the team 
promises.

Hagai.
