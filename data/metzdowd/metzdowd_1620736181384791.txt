As the other posters have already commented, encryption alone does not
(in general) provide integrity. Furthermore, care must be taken in how
the encryption scheme and the MAC are combined, with
encryption-followed-by-MACing-the-ciphertext being the best choice
unless you know what you are doing. For further discussion, see the
textbook by Katz-Lindell (Section 4.9), and/or the following paper:
