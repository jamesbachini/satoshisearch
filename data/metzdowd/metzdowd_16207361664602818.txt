  I also disagree.  It's not like anyone says to themselves &quot;Hey, this website
is taking me several seconds to access - I'll spend a couple of hours
physically going to the shop instead&quot;.  It's economics again: what amount of
time or money constitutes &quot;too much&quot; depends what the alternative choices are.
