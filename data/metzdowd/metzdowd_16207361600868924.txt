Here's Dr. Donald MacLean Kerr, Jr's original speech that led to the
AP story about security, privacy, and anonymity.  It's more nuanced
than what the AP reported, but still basically wrong.  At least
there's somebody high up who's saying we don't have to trade privacy
for security.  (Instead he says we have to trade anonymity for
security.)

OK, Dr. Kerr, what's your address, birth date, and SSN?  Where do your
kids live?  What, don't you trust us?  You want all that info about
us, and trust is a two-way street.

What do we have to trade, to be secure from you and the rest of the
corrupt federal government -- which is working tomorrow on granting
itself retroactive impunity for crimes of high treason?  Why should I
trust *you* more than I trust the average illegal immigrant?  Those
immigrants aren't part of an organization designed to do mass murder
and get away with it; you are.

Dr. Kerr, read _The Transparent Society_ by David Brin.  He's thought
about it more than you have.  He thinks to be safe from tyranny, we'll
have to get rid of both privacy AND anonymity.  But this will be much
safer than losing privacy and anonymity AND being subject to tyrants.
