Yep. It seems like we've had a bit of this conversation recently, 
haven't we? ;-&gt; And it is not just the gatekeepers, but also the 
users who need education. We know that we will not have enough 
&quot;gatekeepers&quot; to watch all users and uses.

Given this, the real question is, /&quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot;/ 
(Given as either &quot;Who will watch the watchers themselves?&quot; or &quot;Who 
will guard the guardians?&quot; from Juvenal.) Here we have the perfect 
examples of the conundrum in No Such Agency or the Company, who 
evade oversight or it is so obfuscated that the watchers at the 
political level either don't know what is really going on or they 
are complicit. Funny how something as off the main track of society 
as cryptography still reflects the identical problems of the greater 
whole, isn't it?

I also argue that badly structured protocol requirements that 
potentially obfuscate what is going on is a serious issue as well. 
Then too, there is documentation that does not get down to the bare 
metal, so to speak, so that those who are not skilled at reading 
code, and its implications, can understand what is going on. The 
Romans knew that and mad it law: /Quod non est in actis, non est in 
mundo./ (&quot;What is not in the documents does not exist&quot;)

All of this requires team thinking so that everyone who is looking 
at the issues involved, no matter from what direction, creator, 
auditor or end user, gets &quot;it.&quot;
