Well, kerberos does both, really. It also has the advantage that it
is fully specified and integrates with GSSAPI.

&gt;<i>    That they both use very similiar concepts &amp; components

</I>&gt;<i>    the strength and flexibility of the underlying components rather
</I>&gt;<i>    than to a weakness of SKSML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) AFAIK, Kerberos clients cannot deliver their stated benefit (network
</I>&gt;<i>    authentication) in the absence of the network or the Kerberos server.

It is generally hard to deliver network authentication without a
network. That said, kerberos tickets can persist even in the face of
disconnects, so once you've connected tickets can survive as long as
you wish.

&gt;<i>    SKSML is designed to allow disconnected EKMI clients to continue
</I>&gt;<i>    providing cryptographic services to applications even in the absence
</I>&gt;<i>    of the network or the key-management server.  However, it does
</I>&gt;<i>    require that the Symmetric Key Client Library (SKCL) have connected
</I>&gt;<i>    to the Symmetric Key Services (SKS) server at least once before it
</I>&gt;<i>    can use this capability.
</I>
That's no different from Kerberos, and kerberos works quite well
already.
