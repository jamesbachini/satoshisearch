I think you are hitting a key point here. In a way - a CA (or some sub- 
CA) is less of an authority and more of a, ideally, somewhat  
consistent organizational realm.

And at the same time we need to learn to, or be weaned away from, the  
hardened shell perimeter ideas, that of a single super reliable root -  
and start to see a CA as something like one of the Kerberos KDC's we  
trust, just a NIS+ server we like, etc.
