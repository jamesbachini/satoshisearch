<PRE>For an interesting discussion of IPETEE, see:

www.educatedguesswork.org/moveabletype/archives/2008/07/ipetee.html

Brief summary:  This is an initial discussion - the results of a
drinking session - that got leaked as an actual proposal.  The
guys behind it are involved with The Pirate Bay.  The goal is
to use some form of opportunistic encryption to make as much
Internet traffic as possible encrypted as quickly as possible -
which puts all kinds of constraints on a solution, which in
turn also necessarily weakens the solution (e.g., without some
required configuration, there's no way you can avoid MITM
attacks) and forces odd compromises.
