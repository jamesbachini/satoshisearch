I was shocked that several people posted in response to Peter
Gutmann's note about Wachovia, asking (I paraphrase):

&quot;What is the problem here? Wachovia's front page is only http
protected, but the login information is posted with https! Surely this
is just fine, isn't it?&quot;

I'm not going to explain why this is wrong. It should be obvious. If
it isn't obvious to you, you should try thinking like an attacker for
a few moments. If it still isn't obvious to you why this is very bad,
read the list archives.

(I won't be forwarding followups to this unless they are unusually
interesting.)
