<PRE>My understanding, based mostly on what I've read in the press, is that
COFFEE is a set of scripts that run existing tools, making it easier
for law enforcement to do things which are already known to be
possible.  Note the words &quot;executing 150 seperate commands,&quot; which, I
think, would be odd if this was something other than scripts, but
appear in a lot of the news stories.

For example, I believe that there are several freely available
password cracking tools and some commercial ones. For example, you can
order John the Ripper to decrypt a system password on some operating
systems.  I have no idea if a password cracker is included.

Speaking for me.

The Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor, or COFEE for short, is a USB thumb drive that contains software capable of executing approximately 150 separate commands. Once plugged in, COFEE can be ordered to decrypt system passwords, display a history of internet activity, and search the system for evidence....&quot;
