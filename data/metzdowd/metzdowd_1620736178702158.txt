Call me a speciest, but it's not clear if Rice's Theorem applies to
humans.

While Marcos' approach is somewhat off the mark (&quot;source-code
equivalent that works for me&quot; vs. &quot;conformance of potentially
malicious code to a harmless spec&quot;), keep in mind that object code
validation has been performed for safety-critical code for quite a
while.  The idea is that code for which some soundness property cannot
be shown simply fails validation.  It doesn't matter if the validator
is not clever enough, or if the code is actually bogus.

(And for most (all?) non-trivial software, source code acquisition
costs are way below validiation costs, so public availability of
source code is indeed a red herring.)
