&gt;<i>At first, it seems neat. But then, looking at how it works in practice: the

Correction, &quot;exactly like phishing criminals are actively doing right now&quot;
(hat tip to Don Jackson of SecureWorks who's investigated and documented this
practice).  Given the almost complete failure of client certs in the
marketplace, I found it most amusing that the current active users of &quot;client
certs&quot; are phishers.  It reminded me of spammers and SPF.

Thus postdating Microsoft's CertEnroll/Certenr3/Xenroll ActiveX control by
several years.  The only difference here is that the user generates the cert
directly rather than involving a CA.
