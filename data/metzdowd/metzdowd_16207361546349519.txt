One can test a source of randomness by checking statistics of its few
samples, but if I understand the article correctly, in case of SRAM
each cell behaves as an independent source of randomness: some bits
are almost always stuck at fixed values while others have some
freedom. In this case it is pointless to do tests using initial SRAM
state after a single power on, because to gather a few samples from
each source one needs to repeatedly reset the device.

Applying statistical tests to a hash of the whole SRAM does not make
much sense either -- a good hash function will give statistically good
results even if you give it a counter.
