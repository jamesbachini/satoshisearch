there was a detailed analysis of the 99/00 smartcard deployments ... looking 
at the most common causes for problems. this was overlapped with opinion
claimed to be widely held among consumer financial institutions, that it had 
been proven that smartcards were not practical in the consumer market segment.

for something of a lark, at the annual smartcard conference, i went around to
most of the booths asking people at the booth if they were 1) aware 
that the financial industry considered smartcard not practical in the
consumer market segment and 2) what was the cause of the majority of the
problems.

some of the major deployments selected to be pc/sc compliant ... which at the
time only supported serial port attachment ... and did not support USB plug&amp;play.
It turned out that the vast majority of smartcard deployment problems in that time-frame
had to do with consumers trying to install serial port card readers, consumers
that couldn't find the serial port, serial port connections that conflicted with
something else, serial port conflicts, serial driver conflicts (large number of BSOD 
and consumers having to re-install their systems from scratch).

there was then a very complex and intricate series of negotiations getting
agreement to upgrade pc/sc to support USB plug&amp;play (for starters, responses 
like why even bother since it had been proven already that smartcards weren't 
practical in the consumer marketplace ... ignoring for a moment that major
factor in the failures was the pc/sc serial port limitations) . 

There were also things like  alternative packaging ... USB keyboard with 
built-in smartcard reader, display,  and PIN-pad cut-out switch ... where 
keyboard incremental cost was more like $5  (but again, it required PC/SC 
to be upgraded to USB plug&amp;play)

however, by that time, nearly every where you went, there were echos that it (some
deployment or another) had proven that smartcards were not practical in consumer 
environment. Note that it wasn't just consumer limited, there were instances where 
commercial  operations figured that it would be on the order of $500/PC to be able 
to handle PC/SC serial port smartcard reader attachments.

it was in the midst of these particular disasters that you also saw some of
the smartcard operating system projects being canceled (again the spreading
belief that smartcards were not practical in the consumer market place).
All of this can be pretty much put at the doors of the institutions failing
to understand some of the fundamental issues attempting to deploy serial-port
PC/SC in the PC market place of the time (and/or understand that large
driver behind doing the whole USB plug&amp;play thing was the significant problem
and issues attempting to deal with the serial port implementation)

some number of past posts mentioning the whole PC/SC serial port problems
encountered with various attempts at smartcard deployments in the
PC/consumer marketplace
