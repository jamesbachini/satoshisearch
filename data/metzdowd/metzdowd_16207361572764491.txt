Windows have had FDE (with pre-boot) solutions for a  long while. Here
is a list: <A HREF="http://www.full-disk-encryption.net/Full_Disc_Encryption.html">http://www.full-disk-encryption.net/Full_Disc_Encryption.html</A>

Note: BitLocker is NOT true FDE. It is only volume based encryption.
It has 3 modes. In one of the mode you can store the key on a external
USB device. Only in that mode BitLocker acts as a FDE solution with
pre-boot.
