I don't have any idea why or why not, but all they can release now is
source code with #ifdef openssl &gt;= 0.9.9  ... do PSK stuff ... #endif,
with binaries (dynamically) linked against the default OpenSSL on the
oldest supported release of each platform... For RedHat 4.x systems,
for example, that means that binary packages use 0.9.7...

Distributions that build their own Firefox from source may at some point
have PSK (once they ship OpenSSL 0.9.9). I don't think we will see this
available in many user's hands for 2-3 years after the code is written
(fielding new systems to the masses takes a long time...).
