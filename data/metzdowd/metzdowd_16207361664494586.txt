&gt;<i>From what I can gather from their black text on a dark-grey background, all

been using one-time CC numbers for awhile now, all this is doing is garnishing
them with an extra layer of biometric magic.  The important thing isn't the
biometrics, it's the one-use-only CC number that provides the security, and
that's not really new.
