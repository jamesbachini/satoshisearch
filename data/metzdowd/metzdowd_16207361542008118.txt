You've forgotten Hanlon's razor, &quot;Never attribute to malice that which can be
adequately explained by stupidity&quot;.  So the comment should really be:

  All this attack allows is for one side of a DH exchange to inadvertently
  downgrade the security,

This sort of thing has happened several times in the past (with RSA, not DH in
this case), one example being the CA-issued exponent-one certs that I
mentioned previously, the other being an implementation that shall go unnamed
that sent out plaintext because the developers didn't do key paramter
validation.  So the problem isn't a deliberate attack, it's screwups by people
implementing or deploying the crypto.
