<PRE>&gt;<i> &quot;There are, of course, obstacles that must still be overcome by EKMI 
</I>&gt;<i> proponents. For example, the proposed components are somewhat simple 
</I>&gt;<i> by design, which concerns some encryption purists who prefer more 
</I>&gt;<i> complex protocols, on the logic that they're more difficult to break 
</I>&gt;<i> into.&quot;

Let me first say that from the discussion here I now get the impression
that this is how criticism of the EKMI spec is being characterized by its
supporters. Their critics are &quot;encryption purists&quot;. I'm not sure what
that means but it sounds kind of like &quot;people who believe in security
over simplicity&quot;.

An example where this concern might arise would be an overly simplistic
protocol that used AES in ECB mode - &quot;simple by design&quot;, while the
&quot;encryption purist&quot; advocated GCM, &quot;more difficult to break into&quot; but
more complex.  Now, I'm sure EKMI is not doing things this way but it
is an example where &quot;simple&quot; would not look good to &quot;encryption purists&quot;.
