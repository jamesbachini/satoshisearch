I've only just seen this, but I've been playing with the VIA's AES and
looking at Intels AES instructions.

I believe the PPERM instruction will be rather important.  Combined with
the packed byte rotate and shift some rather
interesting SIMD byte fiddles should be possible.

&gt;<i>From my initial look, it should be possible to implement AES without

I've not looked at it enough yet, but currently I'm doing an AES round
in about 140 cycles a block (call it 13 per round plus overhead) on a
AMD64, (220e6 bytes/sec on a 2ghz cpu) using normal instructions.  I
don't believe they will be taking 30 instructions , so they probably
have 4-8 SSE instructions per round, it then comes down to how many SSE
execution units there are to execute in parallel.

As for VIA, on a 1ghz C7 part, cbc mode, 128bit key, for 16byte aligned,
I'm getting about 24 cycles per block, for unaligned, about 67 cycles. 
The chip does ECB mode at 12.6 cycles a block if aligned (2 at a time). 
It does not handle unaligned ECB, so with manual alignment, 75 cycles. 
Not bad for a single issue cpu considering the x86 instruction version
of AES I have
takes 1010 cycles per block.

For the intel AES instructions, from my readings, it will be able to do
a single AES (128bit) in a bit more that 60 cycles
(10 rounds, 6 cycle latency for the instructions).  The good part is
that they will pipeline.  So if you say do 6
AES ecb blocks at once, you can get a throughput of about 12 cycles a
block (intel's figures).  This is obviously of relevance for counter
mode, cbc decrypt and more recent standards like xts and gcm mode.

Part of the intel justification for the AES instruction seems to stop
cache timing attacks.  If the SSE5 instructions allow AES
to be done with SIMD instead of tables, they will achieve the same
affect, but without as much parallel upside.

It also looks like the  GF(2^8) maths will also benefit.
