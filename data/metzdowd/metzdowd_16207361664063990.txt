by the Stored Communications Act, 18 USC 2701
(<A HREF="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2701.html">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2701.html</A>).  While it's not a
well-drafted piece of legislation and has been the subject of much
litigation, from the Steve Jackson Games case
(<A HREF="http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/">http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/</A>) to Warshak v. United States

see how you can say stored email isn't protected at all.
