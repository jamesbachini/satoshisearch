I view EKMI as using the best tools the cryptographic community has to
offer to solve specific business problems.  As I stated in an earlier
e-mail, one man's meat is another man's poison.  What you see as
additional layer of complexity is viewed as a layer of simplification
by some people - no different from how one might view a self-starter
in an automobile, as a layer of complexity over a crank-starter.

To the extent that anyone can claim familiarity with something as
fickle and temporal as the needs of an audience, I believe I do (for
the moment).  I recognize that I cannot please everyone in any
audience, and must therefore, do/say what what I believe is right for
my customers.  Only time will tell if I got it right - temporarily.
