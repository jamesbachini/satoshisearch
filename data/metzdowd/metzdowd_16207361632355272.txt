Believe it or not, I thought of CFB...

Sending keep-alives will do nasties to battery lifetime, I suspect;
most of the time, you're not typing.  As for CFB -- with a 64-bit block
cipher (you want them to use DES? they're not going to think of anything
different), it will take 9 keypresses to flush the buffer.  With AES
(apparently your assumption), it will take 17 keypresses.  This isn't
exactly muggle-friendly.  Just think of the text in the instructions...
Redundancy?  I wonder how much is needed to avoid problems.  It has to
be a divisor of the cipher block size, which more or less means 8 extra
bits.  How much will that cost in battery life?
