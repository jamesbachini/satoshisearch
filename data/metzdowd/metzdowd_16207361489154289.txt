Hm.  Okay, we're looking at the same law, and I am not a lawyer
either; but I read &quot;knowing or having reason to know ... that such
device or any component thereof has been or will be sent through the
mail or transported in interstate or foreign commerce&quot; as a limiting
clause on what would otherwise be an unconstitutional law.

In the case of someone who manufactures and posesses such a device,
but never sends it or its components through the mail nor transports
it in interstate or foreign commerce, I don't think this law gets
broken.  Despite intimidation tactics that do their best to try to
spread the opposite impression, this is explicitly *not* forbidden by
this law.

And the statute on using such a device, IIRC, also has a limitation,
in that it bans using such devices *surreptitiously* - which I think
permits non-surreptitious use such as demonstrations.

Still, it's a case of two reasonably educated people being able to
look at the same statute and draw different conclusions: Sooner or
later it will have to be decided in a trial to see who can pay the
best lawyers^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H see which
interpretation of the statute best serves justice.
