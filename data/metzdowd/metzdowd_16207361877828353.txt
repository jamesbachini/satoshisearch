I came across this paper today while searching for more information:

<A HREF="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/theses/crutchfield-masters-thesis.pdf">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/theses/crutchfield-masters-thesis.pdf</A>

It's titled 'Security Proofs for the MD6 Hash Function Mode of
Operation' by Christopher Yale Crutchfield (certified by Ronald L.
Rivest).  I thought it might be of interest to the followers of this
thread.
