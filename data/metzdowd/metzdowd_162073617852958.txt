If it doesn't apply to humans, that implies that humans are somehow
able to do computations that Turing Machines can't. I am sufficiently
skeptical of that to say, flat out, I don't believe it. If anything,
Turing Machines are more capable -- humans are only equivalent to
(large) finite state machines.

Certainly. You can use formal methods to prove the properties of
certain specially created systems -- the systems have to be produced
specially so that the proofs are possible. What you can't do in
general is take an existing system and prove security properties after
the fact.
