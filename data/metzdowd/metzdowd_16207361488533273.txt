This is a nice, calm analogy, and I think it is useful. But it misses 
the point of the snake oil entirely.

The fact that there is some good quantum crypto theory doesn't mean 
that there is any application in the real world. For the real world, 
you need key distribution. For the cost of a quantum crypto box (even 
after cost reductions after years of successful deployment), you 
could put a hardware crypto accelerator that could do 10,000-bit DH.

Going back to the theory, the only way that quantum crypto will be 
more valuable than DH (much less ECDH!) is if DH is broken *at all 
key lengths*. If it is not, then the balance point for cost will be 
when the end boxes for quantum crypto equals the cost of the end 
boxes for still-useful DH.

Oh, and all the above is ignoring that DH works over multiple hops of 
different media, and quantum crypto doesn't (yet, maybe ever).
