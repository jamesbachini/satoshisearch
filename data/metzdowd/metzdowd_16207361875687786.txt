See &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value</A>&gt;.

Since p-value is supposed to be uniform on the interval [0,1]
for a truly random source, it is no wonder that with so many
p-values some of them are close to 0 and some are close to 1.

If your p-value is smaller than the significance level (say, 1%)
you should repeat the test with different data and see if the
test persistently fails or it was just a fluke.
