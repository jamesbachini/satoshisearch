If the salt space is large enough ( &gt; 128 bits, say) and the salts  
are generated with a good source of randomness, then it's  
overwhelmingly likely that an attacker will have to do a dictionary  
attack per user anyway, even across many different machines.  Also,  
with such a large salt space it's extremely unlikely that users who  
choose the same passwords will have the same salt.
