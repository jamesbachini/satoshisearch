   Drivers using the automated FasTrak toll system on roads and
   bridges in California's Bay Area could be vulnerable to fraud,
   according to a computer security firm in Oakland, CA.

   Despite previous reassurances about the security of the system,
   Nate Lawson of Root Labs claims that the unique identity numbers
   used to identify the FasTrak wireless transponders carried in cars
   can be copied or overwritten with relative ease.
