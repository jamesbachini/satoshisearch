security&quot; on 9-Aug]

&gt;<i> A critique of modern cryptography
</I>
well, in my reading it's not a &quot;critique of modern cryptography&quot; -- rather, 
it's (1) a comparison of the cultural differences between mathematical 
research and crypto research, and (2) a critique of the crypto research 
subfield known as &quot;provable security&quot;, done using examples culled from Mr. 
Koblitz's personal experience.

and yes, it's worth reading.
