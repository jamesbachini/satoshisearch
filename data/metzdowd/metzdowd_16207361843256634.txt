That's a good point, Ben. Dan Kaminsky's DNS tester at <A HREF="http://www.doxpara.com/">http://www.doxpara.com/</A>
does include output like this:

Your name server, at 1.2.3.4, appears to be safe, but make sure the
ports listed below aren't following an obvious pattern (:1001, :1002,
:<i>1003, or :30000, :30020, :30100...).
</I>Requests seen for dae687514c50.doxdns5.com:
1.2.3.4:34023 TXID=64660
1.2.3.4:50662 TXID=51678
1.2.3.4:55984 TXID=49711
1.2.3.4:17745 TXID=12263
1.2.3.4:26318 TXID=59610 

This shows only the last 5 ports so it won't detect an LCG, but at least
it can detect some of the more obvious patterns.
