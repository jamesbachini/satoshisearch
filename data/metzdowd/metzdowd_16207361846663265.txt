Isn't this a bit of wishful thinking?

The dynamics are probably very involved because you usually don't buy
from NXP, but an integrated product from a reseller.  An upgrade isn't a
free patch, either, so it needs some sort of budgeting and planning.

That being said, the chip should have been phased out years ago.  But
within half a year?  No way.
