Interesting how &quot;virtualization&quot; seems to imply &quot;safe&quot; in the public
mind (and explicitly in that article) right now.... I'm sure with the
increasing use of virtualization, we'll start to see more VMware-aware
malware and virtual machine escapes in the wild. Another example of
putting many, many eggs in the same basket.

Here's a good article about the first public VMware escape, which
Intelguardians demonstrated at SANSFIRE this summer:
(Note: I'm biased, having worked on this project.)

What boggles my mind is that despite this, the DoD has still decided to
rely on virtualization software to keep classified and unclassified info
on the same physical systems:

</I>&gt;<i> The creators of these Trojans and bots not only have very strong software development and testing skills, but also clearly know how security vendors operate and how to outmaneuver defenses such as antivirus software, IDS and firewalls, experts say. They know that they simply need to alter their code and the messages carrying it in small ways in order to evade signature-based defenses. Dittrich and other researchers say that when they analyze the code these malware authors are putting out, what emerges is a picture of a group of skilled, professional software developers learning from their mistakes, improving their code on a weekly basis and making a lot of money in the process.

</I>&gt;<i> Another trend Maeder predicts for 2008 is, at long last, the death of antivirus software and other security products that allow employees to install and download any programs they'd like onto their PCs, and then attempt to weed out the malicious code. Instead, products that protect endpoints by only allowing IT-approved code to be installed will become the norm.
