As someone who is dealing with this operationally, we (SDSC) had already
identified what Steve suggests as the desireable long-term solution.
I would reword the requirement slightly to say that the capability of
sshd should be to block use of any key specified by the adminstrator,
not necessarily just the published blacklist.  I think that's what Steve
may have actually meant, but clarity is helpful.
