Some comments:

* Use of an off-the-shelf algorithm like SHA1 might be nice for &quot;tick here
  for FIPS certification&quot;, but they render the hashing scheme more
  vulnerable to dictionary attacks assisted by (near-)commodity hardware.
  Contrast with OpenBSD's blowfish scheme, which is deliberately designed
  to not be implementable using off-the-shelf crypto accelerator chips.

* Hideously obfuscated and overcomplicated. Comments like those on step 11
  of the algorithm (some mumbo jumbo about a completely deterministic step
  &quot;adding randomness&quot;) and the absence of any rationale for the complexity
  seem to indicate that they believe a complicated design will somehow
  thwart attacks by itself.

* Why specify the number of rounds directly? Most password and KDF schemes
  use an exponential scheme to match Moore's law.
