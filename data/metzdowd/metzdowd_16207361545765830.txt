The way I read it, it is a critique of the (somewhat inevitable) poor
quality of peer-review for conference proceedings, and the author is
indirectly complaining that more traditional journals are not always
the norm for crypto research that sets best-practice standards.

In a nutshell: important ideas deserve time, rather than Internet-time.

This part is not too radical. The more specific scepticism of security
proofs (I am reluctant to agree that these are actively harmful), seems
to be a combination of the peer review issue above, and (often?) lack of
tight bounds that make the proofs applicable to realistic parameter sizes.
