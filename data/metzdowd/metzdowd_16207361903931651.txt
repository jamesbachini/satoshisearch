This is precisely the issue.

There are any number of cryptographic techniques that would allow
clients and servers to authenticate to each other in a phishing
resistant fashion, but they all depend on ensuring that the
*client* has access to the password and that the attacker can't
convince the user to type their password into some dialog
that the attacker controls. That's the challenging technical
issue, but it's UI, not cryptographic.
