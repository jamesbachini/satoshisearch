Well. Kinda. It didn't really explain why:

		i=fread(buf,1,n,in);
		if (i &lt;= 0) break;
		/* even if n != i, use the full array */
		RAND_add(buf,n,(double)i);

There is in theory a second place where it might used an uninitialised 
buffer, but I think in practice that never happens.

I'd note that ISO/IEC 9899 says the result of doing this is undefined, 
so I am inclined to remove it from future releases.
