I think you missed John's point, which is that two-person *login* says
*nothing* about what happens once logged in -- logging in enables
arbitrary subsequent transactions that may not require two people to
acquiesce.

What if one of the persons leaves the other alone to do whatever they
wish with the system?  Or are the two persons chained to each other?
(And even then, there's no guarantee that they are both conscious at the
same time, that no third person shows up and knocks them out *after*
they've logged in, ...)

When you force two people to participate on a *per-transaction* basis
then you probably get both of them to pay attention, though such schemes
might not scale to thousands, or even hundreds of transactions per-team,
per-day.
