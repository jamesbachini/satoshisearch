In fact, I see security questions as a security weakness.

My typical answer is random garbage, such as output of pwgen -s -y 48 1. 
This can be discarded then. Or, at least, gpw 1 60 (gpw output is less 
secure, but can be stored, remembered, and even written in on simplified 
keyboards)

But never mind, these people will be picked up by by government 
datamining as un-normal (terrorist suspects) and imprisoned. Problem solved.
