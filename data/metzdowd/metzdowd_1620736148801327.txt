Doesn't this one count?

|<i> According to Chief Superintendent Arye Edelman, head of the Tel Aviv
</I>|<i> fraud squad, which ran the investigation, Haephrati used two methods
</I>|<i> to plant his malicious software (or malware) in the target
</I>|<i> computers. One was to send it via e-mail. The other was to send a disk
</I>|<i> to the target company that purported to contain a business proposal
</I>|<i> from a well-known company that would arouse no suspicions. Then, when
</I>|<i> an employee loaded the disk to view the proposal, the Trojan horse
</I>|<i> would infect his computer.
