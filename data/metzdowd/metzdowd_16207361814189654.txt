<PRE>|<i> There's an option 2b that might be even more practical: an S/MIME or
</I>|<i> PGP/MIME forwarder.  That is, have a trusted party receive your mail,
</I>|<i> but rather than forwarding it intact encrypt it and then forward it to
</I>|<i> your favorite IMAP provider.
</I>Excellent idea!  I like it.

Of course, it's another piece of a distributed solution that you need
to keep running.  It would make for an interesting third-party
service.  (On the surface, letting a third party run this for you
seems hazardous, but as always your stuff is exposed on the way
to the forwarder whatever you do....

A forwarded like this as a pre-packaged EC2 VM, perhaps?
