The PRNGs in SP800-90 are listed in the current Annex C (see
item #6 on page 4; this occurred in January of this year).
<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexc.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402annexc.pdf</A>

There is no algorithm testing for the SP800-90 RNGs yet, but they are
allowed for use in the approved mode of operation because of IG 1.10
(<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/140-1/FIPS1402IG.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/140-1/FIPS1402IG.pdf</A>).  You'll also want
to read IG 1.12, which directly pertains to the testing that is required
to test the vendor's assertion that they have a compliant SP80-90 RNG.

Yes.  The requirement imposed by FIPS 140-2
(<A HREF="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf">http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf</A>)
are in section 4.7.2:
 &quot;Compromising the security of the key generation method (e.g., guessing
 the seed value to initialize the deterministic RNG) shall require as
 least as many operations as determining the value of the generated key.&quot;
(which would apply to any RNG output that became a key)

and in section 4.7.3:
 &quot;Compromising the security of the key establishment method (e.g.,
 compromising the security of the algorithm used for key establishment)
 shall require at least as many operations as determining the value of
 the cryptographic key being transported or agreed upon.&quot;
(which would apply to any RNG output that is used in a security relevant
way in a key establishment scheme)
