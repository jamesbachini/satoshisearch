I can't believe I'm getting into this with James.

Ignoring the technical question of &quot;broken&quot;, I know of no evidence
whatsoever that round trip latency is in any way a limiting factor for
people to use SSL/TLS.  I've heard of people resisting using SSL for
performance concerns, but they're almost always about the RSA
operation on the server (and hence the cost of server hardware).

If you have some evidence I'd be interested in hearing it.
