<PRE>Hi Florian,

&gt;<i> I'm looking for a halfway self-contained set of ITU-T recommendations
</I>&gt;<i> which are relevant for implementing X.509v3 certificates.  The
</I>&gt;<i> references in RFC 3280 appear to be incomplete; for instance, a
</I>&gt;<i> reference for ASN.1 itself is missing.
</I>
The ITU recently started allowing free downloads of all their  
standards. The ASN.1 standards have been free for download for several  
years. You can download them at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/en">http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X/en</A>&gt;.

&gt;<i> Or is it unreasonable to expect that the specs match what is actually
</I>&gt;<i> needed for interoperability with existing implementations (mostly in  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> TLS, S/MIME area)?
</I>
I can't help you there. You can see my opinion on this issue towards  
the middle of Peter Gutmann's page at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/</A> 
 &gt;.

Regards,
Aram Perez
