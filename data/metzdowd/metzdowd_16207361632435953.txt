 &gt;&gt; Keep in mind that the notary is still 'careful' --

 &gt;&gt; actual code) or state that _a_ document was presented
 &gt;&gt; with said hash.

 &gt; And that makes all the difference.  The digital notary

 &gt; There is no problem, and the described attack does not

The described attack does apply:  The notary has
complied with normal procedures and with the rules, but
the rules and procedure fail to have the desired effect,
because an MD5 hash lacks the desired properties.
