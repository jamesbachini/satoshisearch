<PRE>Today's VMMs aren't even designed to fit the formal criteria for a VMM
(at least as expressed, intelligently, by Popek and Goldberg back in the
70s).  VMM-aware malware leverages this: for example, by making calls to
VMware's &quot;backdoor&quot; communications channel from the guest (ie. jerry.c).
If the &quot;equivalence&quot; principle were actually upheld, this wouldn't be
possible-- but then again, users wouldn't have all those handy features
like cut-n-paste from guest to host.

</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, the first real tie of VMM's to security was in a DEC

</I>&gt;<i> Book A2 level.  The primary argument for this was:  Existing OS's are
</I>&gt;<i> way too complex to verify (and in any case A2 required verified design,
</I>&gt;<i> which is impossible to apply to an already-existing design).  A VMM can
</I>&gt;<i> be small and simple enough to have a verified design, and because it
</I>&gt;<i> runs &quot;under&quot; the OS and can mediate all access to the hardware, it can
</I>&gt;<i> serve as a Reference Monitor.  The thing was actually built and met its
</I>&gt;<i> requirements (actually, it far exceeded some, especially on the
</I>&gt;<i> performance end), but died when DEC killed the VAX in favor of the
</I>&gt;<i> Alpha.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Today's VMM's are hardly the same thing.  They are built for perfor-
</I>&gt;<i> mance, power, and managability, not for security.  While certainly
</I>&gt;<i> smaller than full-blown Windows, say, they are hardly tiny any more.
</I>&gt;<i> Further, a major requirement of the VAX VMM was isolation:  The
</I>&gt;<i> different VM's could communicate only through network protocols.  No
</I>&gt;<i> shared devices, no shared file systems.  Not the kind of thing that
</I>&gt;<i> would be practical for the typical uses of today's crop of VM's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The claim that VMM's provide high level security is trading on the
</I>&gt;<i> reputation of work done (and published) years ago which has little if
</I>&gt;<i> anything to do with the software actually being run.  Yes, even as they
</I>&gt;<i> stand, today's VMM's probably do provide better security than some -
</I>&gt;<i> many? - OS's.  Using a VM as resettable sandbox is a nice idea, where
</I>&gt;<i> you can use it.  (Of course, that means when you close down the sandbox,
</I>&gt;<i> you lose all your state.  Kind of hard to use when the whole point of
</I>&gt;<i> running an application like, say, an editor is to produce long-lived
</I>&gt;<i> state!  So you start making an exception here, an exception there
</I>&gt;<i> ... and pretty soon the sand is spilled all over the floor and is in
</I>&gt;<i> your eyes.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The distinction between a VMM and an OS is fuzzy anyway.  A VMM gives
</I>&gt;<i> you the illusion that you have a whole machine for yourself.  Go back
</I>&gt;<i> a read a description of a 1960's multi-user OS and you'll see the
</I>&gt;<i> very same language used.  If you want to argue that a small OS *can
</I>&gt;<i> be* made more secure than a huge OS, I'll agree.  But that's a size
</I>&gt;<i> distinction, not a VMM/OS distinction....
