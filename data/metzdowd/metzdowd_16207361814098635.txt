Interesting.  Of course, with the possible exception of Skype, only the 
over-the-network part of the communication is protected.  The IM 
providers can still give the contents of your communications to third 
parties.

As OTR has shown, it's not hard to do end-to-end crypto even if you 
don't have direct client connectivity.  Makes one wonder why the default 
clients don't have the functionality :)
