Hmm, how about Triple-DES for starters? :-) There are cards using 3DES
(called Mifare DESfire) available from the same manufacturer (NXP) as
the Mifare Classic cards with the proprietary algorithm that we looked
at. Apparently the main difference is that DESfire cards cost 1.50 EUR
per piece while Classic cards are at 0.50 EUR per piece. Other public
transport systems, such as Madrid, did the sensible thing and chose
DESfire:
