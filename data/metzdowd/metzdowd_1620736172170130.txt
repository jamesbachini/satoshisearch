  Yes it is, without redesigning the PCI bus.  A bus-mastering capable
device doesn't need any interaction with or acknowledgement from the host,
it doesn't need any driver to be loaded and running, it just needs
electrical connectivity in order to control the entire system.  (I suppose
you could disable the BAR mappings when you go to locked mode, but that's
liable to mess up any integrated graphics set that uses system memory for
the frame buffer, and you'd better not lock your terminal while your SCSI
drives are in operation...)
