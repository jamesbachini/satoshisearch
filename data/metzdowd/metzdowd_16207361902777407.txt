The average cryptographic expert finds it tricky to set up something 
that is actually secure.  The average bureaucrat could not run a pie 
stand.  Legislation and so forth requires wise and good legislators and 
administrators, which is unlikely.

Visualize Obama, McCain, or Sarah Palin setting up your network 
security.  Then realize that whoever they appoint as Czar in charge of 
network security is likely to be less competent than they are.
