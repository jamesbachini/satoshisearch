I forgot to mention that Pt.3 also includes coercive demands for access 
keys - so for instance if Mr Bill Gates came to the UK, and if there was 
some existing question about Microsoft's behaviour in some perhaps 
current EU legal matter, Mr Gates could be required to give up the keys 
to the Microsoft internal US servers. Or go to jail.


Though I'd quite like to see that :), I don't think it would be entirely 
appropriate ...
