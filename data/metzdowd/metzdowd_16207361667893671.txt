If I recall correctly, SSL was designed chronologically after ISO OSI 
Network-Layer Security Protocol (yes, the official WAN was actually X.25 
at one point) or Transport Layer Security Protocol, both in their 
connection-oriented flavor, which used ideas originating from DecNET 
designs (researcher names Tardo, Alagappan; I once had a patent number 
in this thread of protocol engineering, but I lost it). Anyway, the key 
point in these visionary ideas is that the D-H exchange occurs *before* 
the exchange of security certificates. This provided the traffic-flow 
confidentiality that becomes desirable to protect privacy these days.

So, you got your fix with OSI NLSP or TLSP, you just have to overcome 
the *power of the installed base*!
