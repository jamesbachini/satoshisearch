As such, your document is directly applicable to a proposed standard
that is now winding its way through the OASIS process:

<A HREF="http://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/SamlHoKWebSSOProfile">http://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/SamlHoKWebSSOProfile</A>

The proponents of this variant of SAML Web Browser SSO have no
interest in an online database of public keys, but your profile is
relevant nonetheless, for its interoperability aspects.

You mentioned earlier that this may become an IETF RFC.  Do I take
this to mean that your company holds no patent, copyright, trademark
or license rights that would prevent us from relying on your profile?

Thanks,
